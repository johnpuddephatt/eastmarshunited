The family is visited by a man calling himself Inspector Goole, who questions the family about the suicide of a young working-class woman in her mid-twenties.

So when I came to set my art business up in September 2020 it made sense to name it after the chalet, as so much of my work is based around that area of the coast.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1619\" data-permalink=\"https://eastmarshunited.org/eight-foot/\" data-orig-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/eight-foot.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1772,2480\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"eight foot\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/eight-foot.jpg?w=214\" data-large-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/eight-foot.jpg?w=732\" src=\"https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/eight-foot.jpg?w=604\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1619\" srcset=\"https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/eight-foot.jpg?w=604 604w, https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/eight-foot.jpg?w=1208 1208w, https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/eight-foot.jpg?w=107 107w, https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/eight-foot.jpg?w=214 214w, https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/eight-foot.jpg?w=768 768w, https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/eight-foot.jpg?w=732 732w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px\" /><figcaption>Eight Foot</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\" start=\"3\"><li><strong>What does art mean to you?&nbsp;</strong></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>It feeds my soul. If I don’t get to paint each day, I don’t feel right.

I have a constant list of them! I’ve been asked to create some artwork for the round window in Cleethorpes Library, and I’m working towards creating some materials to protect and promote the heritage of the Humberston Fitties. I’d also like to highlight the architectural heritage of the area around Freeman Street. I also want to create a book around H.C. Scaping as his buildings are to be found all over Grimsby. I have a particular love for buildings! If I didn’t have to work, I’d love to travel around the UK by train, and simply spend all day sketching what I saw on my travels!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1618\" data-permalink=\"https://eastmarshunited.org/alexandra-dock-towards-townetsy/\" data-orig-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/alexandra-dock-towards-townetsy.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2480,3543\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"alexandra dock towards townetsy\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/alexandra-dock-towards-townetsy.jpg?w=210\" data-large-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/alexandra-dock-towards-townetsy.jpg?w=717\" src=\"https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/alexandra-dock-towards-townetsy.jpg?w=604\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1618\" srcset=\"https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/alexandra-dock-towards-townetsy.jpg?w=604 604w, https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/alexandra-dock-towards-townetsy.jpg?w=1208 1208w, https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/alexandra-dock-towards-townetsy.jpg?w=105 105w, https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/alexandra-dock-towards-townetsy.jpg?w=210 210w, https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/alexandra-dock-towards-townetsy.jpg?w=768 768w, https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/alexandra-dock-towards-townetsy.jpg?w=717 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px\" /><figcaption>Alexandra Dock towards Town</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\" start=\"5\"><li><strong>what motivates you to paint?&nbsp;</strong></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a compulsion.

We write a lot, and we write in our own unique styles. We break many of the rules of writing that we were taught at school, but we don’t worry about that because it’s our group, it’s our own individual style, and it makes us happy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve been working hard over the months since lockdown ended. So, when we were given the chance to rent a beach hut in Cleethorpes for a day, we quickly became kids again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once we’d unlocked the hut, and once we’d finished with the oohs and ahs over the quaint little sink (I know, we were in a state of great excitement), we put the kettle on. It took ages to boil on the camping stove.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ines did a stress-busting session with us. We stamped our feet, swayed and shouted any negative thoughts out into the Humber. It felt wonderful and we were ready for a cuppa after that!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Full of tea and high spirits, we set off as tourists. First stop: the Cleethorpes Light Railway. You should have seen us waving at everyone we passed. Even dogs got a wave. Pat was humming the theme tune to Ivor the Engine all afternoon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The smell of the steam engine took me back to my childhood in the old steam days.&nbsp;Ryan the engine driver couldn’t help but notice our enthusiasm and he let us each in turn have our photo taken on the foot plate.&nbsp;Kelly did us proud as our official photographer, as you can see from the photos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the way back to the beach hut we ordered breakfast buns and tucked in while we waited for the kettle to boil – again!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The weather was wild, but none of us noticed. In fact, we were pleased it was blowing a gale because we had kites. That’s when we really became children again. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was something I haven’t done since I was nine or ten and on the whole, we did a good job. Even when we couldn’t get them airborne, we had a good laugh. The Olympic gold medal went to Ines, who flew her kite with great expertise. We gathered quite a crowd and at one point I yelled out “It&#8217;s all right our mums know we’re here.”&nbsp; If we’d been given buckets and spades, I’m sure we would have built sandcastles with no complaints.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It felt great to become a child again, even just for a day.&nbsp;</p>\n","<p>We thought it would be really good to check back in with The East Marsh Writing Group now that they/we are able to socialise a lot better &#8216;in the real world&#8217;!

It makes you jump out of bed in the morning because you feel challenged and hopeful at the same time. It calls to that which is emerging and makes you want to be an active part of change. Rebecca Solnit puts it well: ‘Hope is an axe you break down doors with in an emergency; … hope should shove you out the door, because it will take everything you have to steer the future away from endless war, from the annihilation of the earth’s treasures and the grinding down of the poor and the marginal… To hope is to give yourself to the future, and that commitment to the future makes the present inhabitable’.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In other words, optimism is the force that enables you to create a new reality.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Optimism is not the </strong><strong><em>result</em></strong><strong> of achieving a task we have set for ourselves. That is a celebration. Optimism is the necessary </strong><strong><em>input</em></strong><strong> to meeting a challenge.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Optimism is about having steadfast confidence in our ability to solve big challenges. It is about making the choice to tenaciously work to make the current reality better.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Optimism is about actively proving, through every decision and every action, that we are capable of designing a better future.’</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1537\" data-permalink=\"https://eastmarshunited.org/pooh/\" data-orig-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/09/pooh.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"800,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"pooh\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/09/pooh.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/09/pooh.jpg?w=800\" src=\"https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/09/pooh.jpg?w=800\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1537\" srcset=\"https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/09/pooh.jpg 800w, https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/09/pooh.jpg?w=150 150w, https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/09/pooh.jpg?w=300 300w, https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/09/pooh.jpg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></figure>\n","<p>After a week where we Proud East Marshians showed and felt the real power of our community in solidarity, I wanted to share this passage from the book ‘The Future We Choose’ by Christiana Figueres and Tom Rivett-Carnac about the importance of remaining optimistic and nurturing optimism. “Optimism empowers you;

It was purposeful. It felt like something had shifted. What that might be, we can only speculate, but after a year and a half of fearful coronavirus times  &#8211; and now we have the prospect of even more rocky times with big suppliers running out of stuff we all want or need, including toys in the run-up to Christmas, staff shortages, lorry driver shortages, dwindling supplies of petrol, price rises, universal credit cut, stagnating incomes, gas, electric… whatever your politics, this is worrying and disorienting on a felt human level to each and every one of us. Right here, right now. And I guess we each feel collectively helpless in the face of such huge problems. I certainly do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there we were in our Grant Thorold Park. Singing, dancing, talking, laughing, being together genuinely in community, in our East Marsh community along with our friends who came to stand with us. And early reports from our engagement tent suggests that something may have shifted also in the collective East Marshian mindset &#8211; previous events would find people&#8217;s concerns focusing on the negatives, on what is out there now: the consequences of drug use on our streets and in our families, fly tipping, frequent eruptions of anger and violence. These are very real and out there, and we need to acknowledge the impact on our lives. However, feedback on Saturday was almost completely about future plans and what we can do together to really change our park and our streets, to change our East Marsh Village. The day was about standing together connected in love and joy and knowing that this is our strength, this is our foundation, and from here we can remake our East Marsh for our children to grow and flourish.

Those projects do great work and they are important. The problem is that the East Marsh is suffering from the effects of too many problems across all areas of life, and all of the consequences of those problems crossover and have an impact. Housing impacts health which impacts education which impacts work which impacts aspiration. Tackling one of these issues literally means tackling all of them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This leads me to talk about the environment, the physical place where we live. When we discuss the East Marsh, we automatically assume that we are talking about this:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1379\" data-permalink=\"https://eastmarshunited.org/east-marsh-boarded-up/\" data-orig-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/east-marsh-boarded-up.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"5472,3648\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;6.3&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS 6D&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1612529983&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;24&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;320&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.01&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"East Marsh boarded up\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/east-marsh-boarded-up.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/east-marsh-boarded-up.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/east-marsh-boarded-up.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1379\" srcset=\"https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/east-marsh-boarded-up.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/east-marsh-boarded-up.jpg?w=2048 2048w, https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/east-marsh-boarded-up.jpg?w=150 150w, https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/east-marsh-boarded-up.jpg?w=300 300w, https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/east-marsh-boarded-up.jpg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We are all too familiar with the hard concrete streets, the filthy wheelie bins, fly tipping, dog mess, boarded up houses. This is the narrative that we know and it is of course central to the work that is being done. EMU is tackling the mess, the neglect, the attitude and behaviour of slum lords who have allowed the houses to fall into such disrepair, through targeted project work. The East Marsh Construction CIC is tackling work by employing local people to work on improving housing, to undertake repairs and maintenance. This work is happening slowly and it will build.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is however, another side to the East Marsh; a side that is hidden behind the houses, visible to the residents when they open their back doors and look out. It might come as a surprise to see the view from our backyard, but here it is:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1381\" data-permalink=\"https://eastmarshunited.org/view/\" data-orig-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/view.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"5664,2752\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;1.7&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;SM-A920F&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1628686661&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;3.93&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;50&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.00056657223796034&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;longitude&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"View\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/view.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/view.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/view.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1381\" srcset=\"https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/view.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/view.jpg?w=2048 2048w, https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/view.jpg?w=150 150w, https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/view.jpg?w=300 300w, https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/view.jpg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1380\" data-permalink=\"https://eastmarshunited.org/gordons/\" data-orig-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/gordons.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"5664,2752\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;1.7&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;SM-A920F&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1628686665&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;3.93&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;50&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.00091911764705882&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;longitude&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Gordon&#8217;s\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/gordons.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/gordons.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/gordons.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1380\" srcset=\"https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/gordons.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/gordons.jpg?w=2048 2048w, https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/gordons.jpg?w=150 150w, https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/gordons.jpg?w=300 300w, https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/gordons.jpg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We have grand, old trees, a skyline that is not just brick and concrete. It is green and verdant. There are many varieties of birds &#8211; not just seagulls &#8211; even bats at dusk. It is a pleasure to watch the trees as they traverse the seasons, moving from their skeletal frames in winter to their rich greens in high summer and their warm reds and browns in autumn. It is comforting to listen to the wind blow through leaves on blustery days and to hear the songs of blackbirds, finches, starlings and sparrows.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, let’s imagine that we could take some of what is at the back of our houses and apply it to the front, to the streets. Let’s re-imagine street architecture to involve trees, bushes, planters. And let’s go even further. Let’s reduce traffic, let’s find a 20th century solution for those stinking wheelie bins, let’s have a play area for our kids and benches for us to sit with our neighbours and have a chat and a catch up. In short, let’s build a safer, greener, softer place for us all to live.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How hard can it be? We have a government in power that wants to <em>level up. </em>There is money to do this. Here on the East Marsh we have a vision. We can imagine our community as a village, a place where people can live, work, go to school, get together safely under the shade of trees, on pleasant streets where neighbours sit together watching the kids play over a brew and a biscuit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know this can be done, because it has been done elsewhere. What we need is to imagine it, plan it and do it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is already starting. I am watching with great interest the transformation of the Wellspring Academy on Harold Street. Wooden cladding, flower beds and grassy areas have all appeared this summer. Someone imagined that, planned it and made it happen. The kids returning to school in September will be welcomed into a softer, kinder, nicer place. It will have an impact on how they see the environment and their place in it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>East Marsh United is planning to undertake significant work in Grant Thorold Park and on the streets; we will remake our environment. We have imagined it, we are planning it, we will do it. But… we need help. We need friends, allies and doers to come and join us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, EMU tidied a garden up, cut back waste, sorted it out so the resident could feel supported and less worried about their outdoor space.&nbsp; Over a couple of hours, the crew worked, talked and imagined a better East Marsh. We looked at the trees, smelled the wild jasmine, and unearthed an old rose. We heard the birds &#8211; including our amazing seagulls and we really appreciated the environment. In a small but significant way, we showed what can be done.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s make our village together, let’s remake our environment in the shape we want, and let&#8217;s make it green, healthy and beautiful.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1378\" data-permalink=\"https://eastmarshunited.org/crew/\" data-orig-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/crew.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2016,980\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Crew\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/crew.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/crew.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/crew.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1378\" srcset=\"https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/crew.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/crew.jpg?w=150 150w, https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/crew.jpg?w=300 300w, https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/crew.jpg?w=768 768w, https://eastmarshunited.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/crew.jpg 2016w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>The EMU Crew</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n","<p>The idea of doing everything all at once all the time sounds crazy, impossible even but it is the mantra that underpins the work and the ambition of East Marsh United.&nbsp; There are many examples of projects that cover a particular area such as housing, or health or education.

It has talking animals and a giant with green legs along with a kind, brave and clever heroine, Carrie. It also has a serious message and that is about habitat. We know that many habitats are under serious threat and many animal species face vast reduction in numbers or extinction. In the face of this, it can seem impossible for individuals &#8211; let alone children &#8211; to do anything positive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my stories, I try to offer ideas that can help children find small ways to help animals, each other and the environment. In <em>The Magic Garden, </em>Carrie helps protect the habitat of small creatures by not digging up dandelion patches, and her friend Cosmo builds a hedgehog house. These are simple things. On their own, maybe they seem very small.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But imagine if 10,000 gardeners stopped pulling up all the dandelions, or planted lavender and other pollen rich plants instead of short-lived plants that just die off after one summer. Imagine if one thousand gardens had a bug hotel or a hedgehog box or a bee house &#8211; that would make a difference.<strong> We always have to start somewhere.

Rather we sat down together to work out what had brought our neighbourhood to this. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, surprise! We found that poverty played a very important part and that poverty is not a lack of character, it&#8217;s a lack of cash &#8211; but it&#8217;s also about not having access to the benefits of civilisation &#8211; which is why we now have projects in mutual aid, community arts and community education. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a lot of help from friends at the council we have also bought three houses and aim to buy 100 over time so that we can become sustainable over a generation as an ethical community landlord. We also helped get East Marsh Construction under way and they are employing local people doing the refurbishment work that needs doing. We&#8217;re also working with our MP and with Create Streets to really change the architecture of our neighbourhood to make it more people-friendly and to start to green the neglected East Marsh. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If people feel valued, if they have nice homes, nice streets, job opportunities, educational opportunities, health care &#8211; all of the benefits of our civilisation, I would argue they are less likely to be disengaged from society and disrupt the social peace. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a poem by Portia Nelson (below) that sums up what I think we keep doing with our focus on doing the same old things that are clearly not working because we keep on having this discussion and talking about&#8230; doing the same old things! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do you think?

I have reached out a lot throughout the Pandemic with mental health awareness videos and articles. I’ve also been noticed as an ambassador for the local area having spent some time struggling myself throughout my life with mental health and especially in the lockdown.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously I thought about ideas how I could help on how I was feeling and express it in videos and simple messages &#8211; you would be surprised how far they would go and who they would reach. I’ve reached so many celebrities throughout Twitter and they have shared and wrote some lovely positive comments. I just wanted to know if you are feeling down and at times of darkness there is light and by shining a torch through expressing how I was feeling and just a simple message it’s okay not to be okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Others would connect and people would understand that days can be bright but some days can be dark and by doing some videos I have some very positive feedback and messages like how brave I was to open up and Thank you for the videos they have helped me and that made me feel good about myself to as I was struggling at times too but by helping others by doing little bits you find yourself feeling better. I’ve always said if you&#8217;re at that point in your life where you need someone to talk to please talk reach out to friends or a family member &#8211; it’s the start of acknowledging you are struggling but this is not weakness, this is strength. By speaking you will find release and understand that you are not alone and that many others feel the same. By taking time sometimes to have that talk about your day to someone it’s surprising how you can feel afterwards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know myself at times a simple chat can uplift my mood and I’ve just recently mentioned how football can bring people together especially men; a simple conversation about your football team can sometimes unlock a conversation. I find the smallest things we do in life can mean so much and I really appreciate the little messages &#8211; how are you, have a lovely day &#8211; can bring a smile to my face and knowing someone has a thought about you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have met and spoke to some amazing people in my life who have come across some hurdles but take every opportunity to help raise awareness in mental health and these people are warriors who have lived through their experiences. We all share the same interests in helping each other and you would be surprised how much the little things can make the huge difference to someone’s life.  I also met with the Grimsby MP and we spoke about how more in our area needs to be done to continue to raise awareness &#8211; I am all for helping out when I can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know still it’s difficult daily for so many even myself, up and down days, but sometimes all it takes is one person to speak out and you see many more follow and I think that&#8217;s the objective &#8211; to reach out more and more and hopefully it finds the right people because no one should suffer in silence and remember it is okay not to be okay and just because today isn’t great make tomorrow a better day. If you need to talk, talk, reach out, connect. Sometimes a problem shared can help you recognise &#8216;hey I am not the only one experiencing this&#8217; and by knowing you&#8217;re not alone and you can open up as I know for many men it’s hard but finding that strength inside is the start to finding the right help for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take care everyone &#8211; you are not alone. Speak, reach out, don’t suffer in silence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right\">Terry Birkett Grimsby Town mental health ambassador, speaker and advocate&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do check out Terry&#8217;s moving and deeply personal Youtube Channel where he reaches out and connects: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTi_SSchpAMwGn3S_arXnZQ\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTi_SSchpAMwGn3S_arXnZQ </a></p>\n","<p>Hi everyone, my name is Terry Birkett.

I have an idea of how it might work, but the best of it is that I have no idea what it will look like in six months, as our community will help shape the direction of the podcast &#8211; now, that is REALLY exciting!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jill Harrison: “I am really excited to be working on this with Billy and his fellow East Marshians.  From its inception, the WEA actively encouraged members and students to explore topics of interest to them and engage in critical thinking.  We promote social justice and encourage active citizenship &#8211; our vision is of a better world, equal, democratic and just.

Here is her heartfelt account &#8211; thank you , Debbie 🙂</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was about 8 years old when my parents separated; at the time I was the only child in my (quite large) primary school whose parents were getting a divorce. Hard to believe that now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before my parents separated for good, I recall two or three occasions when me and my mum would walk up through our village, our bags packed in readiness for a stay at my Granny’s house. I’m guessing that that was my mum’s refuge (but I’ve never asked her in detail). At the time, and indeed now when I look back, I saw it as a place where my mum felt loved, supported, safe, and a place which gave her space to figure things out. We all need a place like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At YMCA Humber we provide a home, primarily for young people in supported accommodation. Our buildings are inclusive places, where our residents can actively engage in the caring support provided by our coaches. For many, our accommodation is a refuge, a place where they feel secure, supported, cared for; a place where they will not be ‘judged’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am incredibly proud of the work YMCA Humber does. Our accommodation service has a range of properties; from our newly renovated houses with intensive support bringing those formerly street homeless into a home, our bespoke property with round the clock support for care leavers, our Foyer project supporting young people into education, training and work and our move on properties for those who need less support. The property that YMCA Humber is most known for though is our hostel at Peaks Lane. The support we provide in this building makes me equally as proud as the support we offer across our range of other properties, but our building at Peaks Lane does not inspire; it is dated and tired and not of the quality we want to provide. That is why we are building our state of the art £8.3m facility at Freeman Street, at the heart of the East Marsh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We chose this location on the East Marsh because 80% of our current residents have a connection to the East Marsh Ward. This ward might represent their refuge, a place of comfort and familiarity. We want to help our residents re-connect with their roots, their families and the heart of the town. This building will provide a refuge for our residents in an area of Grimsby where they feel they belong. This new building will be a home for many, but will also shout out ’you can achieve your hopes and dreams from here’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this new building will be a welcoming space to many more people than our residents. With amazing community facilities on the ground floor it will serve as a happy place, a place to think, a place to learn, a place to grow for people across the whole of the East Marsh and beyond.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everybody needs a refuge at some time in their lives; a caring environment, a safe space to think, to try something new without fear of failure or judgement. For me, my refuge is my home (and my mum’s home) but that’s not the case for everyone. Our new building will be a much-needed refuge for many, but it will also be so much more than that.</p>\n","<p>The cover of the latest issue of the Proud East Marshian (get it here: <a href=\"https://www.sunandmoonfestival.org/proudeastmarshian\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.sunandmoonfestival.org/proudeastmarshian</a>) shows the emerging new YMCA building.

As you’d expect, there’s humour (look out for the toilet rolls), there’s empathy and there’s positivity: all the traits that sum-up the East Marsh spirit.</p>\n<p>So, the next time you venture out, keep a look-out for these window theatres.

This project could bring the two communities together from the North of England and the South of England with a view of sharing with each other what they are doing within their own communities and to look at ways of how we might work together to bring about real lasting change in our communities.</p>\n<p>If we agree to work together then a small number of East Marsh residents could come to Deptford for say three days (we would provide the funding for this &#8211; similar to us coming here to Grimsby).  To see whats happening there and to meet people fighting for the right to determine the future of their community.</p>\n<p>The next step following this, if we agree, would be for us to think about seeking funding based on our visits to each other’s communities. One way could be to ‘twin’ both communities and over a two or three-year period residents (including young people) from each community would visit each other to talk, listen and to learn from each other’s experiences and create a model which could be used in similar community’s around the UK of how local people can have a real voice and determine the future development of their communities.</p>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n","<p>UPDATE!

Where do we start? At Tortoise, we believe we need to rewrite the rules for politics in a so-called “codified constitution”. But first, how do we get there?

Its trajectory of decline, the loss of its major industry and the total neglect of central government has been replicated throughout the North. However, this is not a story of despair. Despite the scars inflicted by poor housing, low pay, insecure employment and a general lack of hope, we here at East Marsh United have been working against the odds to find a route out of this crisis, making change happen by our own collective effort and sheer force of will. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">A significant group of projects are flourishing but our construction arm, which should be an absolute breakthrough initiative has hit unforeseen difficulties. Our objectives are straightforward given that the two major issues in the ward are housing and skilled, well paid employment: we are buying houses, refurbishing them and providing secure, quality, affordable homes for East Marshians. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">We have secured over £200,000 from the Community Housing Fund, initially to buy three houses on the East Marsh and refurbish them. We will then become an ethical community landlord and as we roll out to forty houses in our four-year plan, we will begin to transform the area &#8211; one house at a time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Integral to this is the recruitment of young people to train and to ultimately gain employment. We have hired two construction professionals and this week ten young people begin a four month programme to become industry-ready, working in a hands-on practical environment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The next phase is to start a two-year apprenticeship with permanent employment on completion. Given the time, effort and planning required to get this far from a standing start you would assume that this latter phase would be a seamless progression &#8211; especially given the terrible, urgent need and our own determination to make this happen, to make our East Marsh home beautiful. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Nope. Our application to the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB) was rejected on the grounds that our organisation is involved in areas of activity other than construction. This means that we miss out on the Apprenticeship Levy drawdown of funding to support the training. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">We haven’t given up. It’s too important &#8211; these are our lives &#8211; and we have taken advice on a new application, a new potential avenue to follow. It feels like a permanent uphill struggle, but we do not give up. Above all, we will not stand by and witness some really excellent young people be deprived of a career and a future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">So, we need a helping hand. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">We would like to link with construction employers, large and small and, if possible, the Grimsby Federation of Master Builders to enable us to provide a bridge from our initial training to a full apprenticeship with them. So, we need local employers to partner us. We can offer you keen, industry-ready applicants with a proven record of attendance and timekeeping earned by working in the industry. This is a huge advantage to you rather than the hazard of taking someone on after only an initial interview. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">And money &#8211; if anybody would like to make a donation to us to help us over this early startup difficulty, that would be greatly appreciated. We’re not set up yet for website donations so if you email </span><a href=\"mailto:info@eastmarshunited.org\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">info@eastmarshunited.org</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> I’ll give bank details for a bank transfer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The skills shortage, both nationally, and locally, is critical. Together, we can break this impasse and offer young people in Grimsby the range of opportunities many of us enjoyed at their age. We can give something back while at the same time employing good people and begin to lift the area. Most importantly we can recreate that increasingly elusive dream, the expectation of a rewarding, secure and worthwhile life. </span></p>\n","<p>Grimsby’s East Marsh is one of the most deprived wards in Europe.

It is a question which misreads the complexity and depth of people’s discontent.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, in the corner room of Grimsby Holiday Inn, the word “Brexit” was uttered once, in passing, and never repeated. Many faces of the town were in the room – sixth formers, community organisers, retirees, volunteers, workers – and nearly all felt let down. The economy, the council, government: very little <em>up there</em> worked for them.</p>\n<p>Key points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Decrepit houses.</em> This part of the discussion naturally focused on East Marsh, one of the most deprived areas in the whole of Europe, let alone Grimsby. The lack of leadership in the ward is typified by its housing: old, uncared for, and of poor quality. A local architect was commissioned by the council to write up a plan, praised by others in the room, to refurbish 15 housing blocks in the area. As far as he is aware, the plans still sit, untouched, in a council drawer somewhere.</li>\n<li><em>“Running in treacle.”</em> The Resolution Foundation diagnosed people’s experience of the job market in four words: “Feel poor, work more.” In the room on Tuesday night, a local seafood employee gave his own four words. They amounted to the same: “Like running in treacle.” A young couple who work 78 hours a week and can barely afford to keep a roof over their heads, and certainly not start a family, is a sign of sickness in the economy.</li>\n<li><em>No recovery.</em> The financial crash still weighs heavily on the town. “Things have just gotten worse and worse since the financial crisis,” said one attendee. Many others agreed. Poor job security, wages that can’t keep up with the rising cost of living, bad prospects particularly for working women. It is no wonder that many young people want out. “There’s this idea,” said a sixth-form student, “that if you come back to your hometown you’ve failed.”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But there is hope, as well as a pride and energy in the town. Local initiatives, such as East Marsh United, want government support to flourish but are not waiting on it to make a start. “This is where we live, this is our home,” said the chair of East Marsh United, a community group trying to renovate housing in the area. “Pensioners shouldn’t have to suffer, young people shouldn’t have to suffer, and, when it comes down to it, us humans shouldn’t have to suffer. That’s it. Full stop. No argument.”</p>\n<p><em>Polly Curtis and David Taylor</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Tortoise will be back in Grimsby twice before the election.

The event, which will run from 10 am – 2 pm at Freeman Street Market, will feature tasters from some of the breads from the calendar, alongside stews, cheeses, and other accompaniments.</p>\n<p>Featuring 12 recipes from 12 different countries, the calendar celebrates the diversity in North East Lincolnshire. It will be a fitting follow-up to the ‘A Town Called Home’ exhibition which proved tremendously popular after its launch in February 2019. Hundreds of visitors flocked to the National Fishing Heritage Centre to read the stories of migrants who have made North East Lincolnshire their home.</p>\n<p>Through Bread from Home, some of these stories will come alive in homes across the county, bringing a little bit of international culture in the form of delicious breads. The Equality Practice, Tracy Todd and Jill Wilson, work closely with people from the Hindu, Sikh, Zimbabwe, Greek, Muslim and Eastern European communities.</p>\n<p>Tracy Todd: “As we chatted about the stories we’d gathered, one theme shone through. Many people spoke about their bread from home. It was something people enjoyed and felt it was part of their life. Sharing their memories of their Bread from their Homes made them smile. We hope this ‘Bread from Home’ Calendar and the recipes it shares, along with the stories, help you reminisce, smile and enjoy, during 2020.”</p>\n<p>The calendar has been a true community effort, with local photographers Inga Bertholds Photography, Arleta Sztandera of Light Grey Photography, and Gary Davies Photography donating their time and talents to take fantastic photos. Gary Davies also gave up his time for the design process.</p>\n<p>The steering committee are volunteers who share, with The Equality Practice, their passion for equality and inclusion. Ruchita Green, Shereen Alankar, Agnieszka Singh and Thelma Hairwadzi are local businesswomen and volunteers who were instrumental in bringing the calendar together.</p>\n<p>Jill Wilson: “Of course, the calendar would not have been possible if it wasn’t for all the participant bakers and storytellers. All have donated their time and baking skills to share their bread from home with us. This means together, we can all share our neighbour’s memories and tastes of home with everyone.”</p>\n<p>Supported by the ‘Love Where You Live’ Fund, the event is free and aims to bring communities together and promote neighbourliness. The calendar will be available to buy on the 30th of November at Freeman Street Market, and via the Hidden Heritage Project Facebook page thereafter. All proceeds go towards the next local community project by the Equality Practice.</p>\n<p>For further information please contact Tracy Todd (07523960723) or Jill Wilson (07722117535) or email info@theequalitypractice.co.uk</p>\n","<p>Bread from home – recipes from across the world, A delicious new calendar for 2020!

They did, and we were such a happy bunch, fleshed out by our friends at YMCA (thank you!) and NELC (thank you, too!) and some East Marshian kids who had heard about all of this and came along to join in (that&#8217;s their work on the boarded up house in Rutland Street, the lovely cat and dog picture).</p>\n<p>It was a very hot day, so we drank plenty of liquids and treated ourselves with cakes &#8211; and it was Vivienne&#8217;s birthday, so what a memorable way to celebrate a phenomenal human! On top of everything we had our Granarchists leading us all in uplifting songs and a very special appearance by the gifted tenor <a href=\"https://encoremusicians.com/Robin-Datta\">Robin Datta</a>, whose voice echoed and tumbled joyously down the whole of Rutland Street.</p>\n<p>Carolyn, our collector of East Marsh Stories, was out collecting those stories from people who live on the street and our plan to tart up the decrepid boarded up houses was simply astonishing &#8211; all these contributions from the <a href=\"https://www.sunandmoonfestival.org/\">Sun &amp; Moon Festival of Community Arts</a>, what a joy that is turning out to be even in these early days!</p>\n<p>We also had a visit from the Absolutely Clueless <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lucylauraclark\">@LucyLauraClark</a> from Radio Humberside, who have also been supporting us via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ClareCrooks\">@Caeros01</a> and shiny new CEO <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheCarlWheatley\">@TheCarlWheatley</a>.</p>\n<p>It was all such fun, and we&#8217;re very happy about how it went, but we have to put the project aside for a little while as we have made a bid for funding to support a whole year of it (it&#8217;s not cheap to do this stuff!). However, now we&#8217;ve had a tryout, we can improve on the way we do it &#8211; and if you have any ideas for improvement, please contact us or leave a comment below.

We want to make a big splash on each ‘Six Feet’ day.</li>\n<li>On the day, we will have our street cleaning volunteers armed with equipment and ready to help everybody and to clean where people are not able to &#8211; some people won’t be able to come and clean their patch, in which case we just ask that they come out and enjoy the morning with us and have a chat about what they love about our community.</li>\n<li>We will hang out our hanging baskets.</li>\n<li>We will have volunteers also from another East Marsh United project, the Sun &amp; Moon Festival performing and being creative – ‘The Granarchists’, our nascent community choir, our growing arts collectives will be decorating the boarded up windows, and our storytellers and writers will be catching ‘East Marsh Stories’ from locals, as well as stories about their tattoos, which very often have a local flavour.</li>\n<li>We will also be promoting East Marsh United’s projects more broadly as a way of bringing more people in to work with and for our community, as well as identifying one or two ‘community mobilisers’ from each street, people who have some heart and passion which we can foster in order to help them support their street in a continuing basis.</li>\n<li>We will start each campaign event by gathering people together and singing a song: Bring me Sunshine&#8230;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In summary, ‘Six Feet of Your Street’ is a programme of community action whereby the community themselves are taking the action and transforming their neighbourhood.

Big claim! But, the word is important to us because it means &#8216;involving or causing a complete or dramatic change&#8217; and it is that kind of change that is needed on our East Marsh &#8211; we want to change ways of thinking, ways of Being, ways of doing. We want people to look around at their lives here and say &#8216;This is Home&#8217;, I&#8217;m proud to live HERE, I&#8217;m a proud East Marshian!</p>\n<p>So, what&#8217;s the &#8216;Festival&#8217; about? First of all, it&#8217;s part of a new, £4million national funding programme called &#8216;Creative Civic Change&#8217; (more <a href=\"http://localtrust.org.uk/news/news-releases/creative-communities-set-to-transform-their-areas-using-creativity\">here</a>). Fourteen communities across England are set to transform their local areas as part of the programme.

says it all &#8211; we East Marshians spent the day communicating with our fellow humans and it felt relaxed and happy and unforced and positive and connected and bursting full with Love and Care and yes it felt JOYOUS!</p>\n<p>We communicated through the power of song, the power of spoken word, the power of historical record (you&#8217;d be surprised how powerful that can be &#8211; our past informs where we are now and where we might want to be&#8230;), the power of art and colour and making and most of all, most of all&#8230; the power of being alongside each other and sharing, sharing food, sharing drink, sharing our stories and above all the power of simply&#8230; Being Together in the World.</p>\n<p>We will be collating our general impressions and our specific ideas (file under &#8216;lots of&#8217;) to help build a 3-year programme of arts and crafts and people power across our East Marsh.</p>\n<p>Thank you to our amazing volunteers, thank you to our artists, thank you to Sean and &#8220;the Mad Harry Atmosphere&#8221; of Freeman Street Market, thanks to SCOPE for lending us a sofa and two armchairs, thank you to the bold and brilliant marvellous marshian who surprised us all by giving us an acapella version of Waterloo, thank you to our superb camerawoman who will be producing a short film of the day for us (can&#8217;t wait!), thank you to the four cafes on the market that provided food for everybody that came and stood with us and thank you to those lovely humans who came and shared beautiful stories and parts of themselves and their experience &#8211; we

&#8211; a fabulous, truly community-minded project funded by NSPCC designed to try and make a real difference to the lives of kids and families in the town. There are on this project clever, serious, passionate people who hold a compassionate and progressive view of humanity and choose to spend their time fighting to help people. East Marsh United works side by side with and values these lovely people and their amazing work and we will continue to stand with them and work with them. And there are lots of organisations converging on the fabulous Tea in the Park at Grant Thorold today, who similarly care passionately about humanity and work very hard to make people&#8217;s lives better. I have met and worked with many of them over the past year or so, charities, police, council, social enterprises, businesses, and our group and I personally have gained immeasurably by being with them; the people of the East Marsh have gained immeasurably from their work, which is often unsung and below the radar. The gathering in the park today is thanks to the truly lovely people at radio Humberside, who are offering many the chance to talk about their work. This is great and we celebrate each and every one of them (and do listen out to Radio Humberside today to hear live the great things that are going on around the East Marsh, and look out for a repeat of the Real Estates Radio Show from the East Marsh on 22nd February at 7pm).</p>\n<p>But.</p>\n<p>When you walk down Rutland street &#8211; for example &#8211; it is very little changed from the chaotic mess it was a year and a half ago when our group began working to address that very chaos. This tells me that many of these lives, these fellow humans &#8211; us, our people! &#8211; still are chaotic. As far as we know, nobody, not one person, not one group, not one organisation, is currently looking at the entire street scene itself in a total and comprehensive way. What if there were some kind of a plan we could put into action to make our streets safer, to let our kids play out in their neighbourhoods, to solve the flytipping and rubbish problems, to reduce crime, to slow cars down and to make our East Marsh a beautiful, pleasing place to live?</p>\n<p>Well, there is. It&#8217;s called the East Marsh Neighbourhood Renewal Area Action Plan and it is big and bold and beautiful and if it were put into action it would transform the East Marsh for a generation.</p>\n<p>Architect Mark Hodson, of Hodson Architects wrote the plan after being commissioned by NELC in 2010. It includes a menu of projects ranging from the very small to the very large, all of which are still relevant. In fact, very little has changed since the plan was published, apart, perhaps, from the fact that the area has further deteriorated during &#8216;austerity&#8217;. As Mark says, the plan offers &#8220;fundamental insight into the predominant physical and social issues facing the East Marsh&#8221;. Reading the plan in 2019, this is still the case.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what NELC said in the plan nearly a decade ago: &#8220;The regeneration of the East Marsh is a major priority for North East Lincolnshire Council and its partners&#8221;. For whatever reason, it clearly isn&#8217;t a priority now. But, it IS a priority for we East Marshians. I would love to hear from people who live on the East Marsh, people who work on the East Marsh, those friends and partners working on and for the East Marsh at the park today &#8211; read the plan, imagine it a reality, would it help in your work with children and families, would it help with your work in preventing crime, would it help with your work in education, in health..?</p>\n<p>This visionary plan, put into action, would help to make us East Marshians proud of our East Marsh once again.</p>\n<p>So, if it&#8217;s there, why isn&#8217;t it happening?</p>\n<p>First of all, such a plan is not on the agenda of any of the helping agencies, it is not on the agenda of the council. The Freemen are making some amazing change happen at the docks end of the East Marsh, but it&#8217;s not where we are, where we live, and as far as I know, apart from the potential &#8216;knock-ons&#8217; of the changes in the Freeman Street area, there are no actual plans to become involved in our patch &#8211; and why would they, they are not responsible for it&#8230;  (we are!)</p>\n<p>Secondly, there is a localised sense of not being able to do anything about anything &#8211; it all seems such a big mess and, well, who knows how to even start?</p>\n<p>But, here&#8217;s the thing. We can do something because we have on our side the heart and strength and passion of we East Marshians, the determination and power held by people who get organised and stand together in common purpose. So, let&#8217;s take this wonderful plan and make it a reality. Let&#8217;s change our world.</p>\n<p>This mess, this chaos that we see around us here, has been made by us humans. Us humans can also unmake it and remake it, but better. Much better. Beautiful. We East Marshians are responsible for OUR East Marsh. We East Marshians CAN make change happen (East Marsh United have been doing it for a year, alongside all our friends and partners).

Well, try standing anywhere here on the East Marsh and then say it out loud. There: cognitive dissonance!</p>\n<p>Some of the things that East Marsh United have been exploring with our partners in the Council and in local and national charitable organisations have been centrally about the distribution of power and resources.  Do we feel we have a share in the national distribution of resources? Should we have? Will Brexit bring greater control, more power to the people? The aim of this event is to see whether we can reach some measure of agreement about how well the country and the economy is run and what can be done to improve matters.</p>\n<p>It takes place from 6-9pm at the Grimsby Neighbourhood Centre, 289a Weelsby St, Grimsby  DN32 7JW.

Text by Tammy&#8230;</p>\n<blockquote><p>After a long hard year of fundraising to rebuild Albion Street Park the team from &#8220;a walk in the park&#8221; are very proud to say we now have a timber trail in the park. The children that use this park often were thrilled when this got put in and it has proved to be very popular with the children who could be seen after school lining up to have a go on the trail. It has took a lot of hard work and a lot of hours to get to this point but to see the big smiles on the children&#8217;s faces made it all worth while. We hope you can continue to support us in this adventure to get more equipment put in the park area. Thank you to everyone who has supported us this far.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"tiled-gallery type-rectangular tiled-gallery-unresized\" data-original-width=\"500\" data-carousel-extra='{&quot;blog_id&quot;:133614333,&quot;permalink&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/eastmarshunited.org\\/2018\\/11\\/20\\/guest-post-from-a-walk-in-the-park-there-is-now-a-timber-trail-for-the-kids-in-albion-street-park\\/&quot;,&quot;likes_blog_id&quot;:133614333}' itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageGallery\" > <div class=\"gallery-row\" style=\"width: 500px;

As Phil says, things have really begun to change in the aftermath of last year&#8217;s horrors on our streets, when action was taken by police and by the community. And as a result of these broadcasts, we&#8217;ve had a deluge of emails, texts and social media exchanges that have been positive, encouraging and proud. Just today, I heard from a landlord from out of town who saw us on the tellie and has himself been encouraged by these changes. He has a property here and he does take care of it and of his tenants &#8211; and he wants to help us in any way he can. So, even if some of our problems are due to irresponsible landlords, and they are, it&#8217;s also important for us to recognise that this is not the whole picture and that there are good people in every social group who are just waiting to step forward and get involved to make change happen, to make all of our lives just that little bit better.

Our bid was entitled &#8216;Finding solutions closest to the challenge&#8217; and the following text is from our bid answering the question &#8216;What would you like to do?&#8217;</p>\n<blockquote><p>Grimsby’s East Marsh is one of the most deprived wards in England with significant poverty indicators and problems of low educational attainment, low employment, high numbers of lone parents, high in-work and pensioner poverty. The summer of 2017 saw the area spiralling out of control: “Rutland Street families &#8216;scared to leave their homes&#8217; because of drug dealing and anti-social behaviour”. “Grimsby man refuses to stop speaking out after his Rutland Street home is attacked by vandals”. Just two of many newspaper headlines from one East Marsh street. Residents felt frightened and helpless &#8211; until we decided to act.</p>\n<p>We adopted the ‘broken window’ theory. Signs of disorder &#8211; broken windows, boarded-up houses, litter and graffiti &#8211; induce more disorder and crime, imply no care for the area and invite chaos, which was what happened. We met to identify how we might mend the ‘broken windows’ and ‘East Marsh United’ (EMU) was born!</p>\n<p>Since September, we have held weekly meetings and since October we have met every Saturday morning to clean one East Marsh Street at a time &#8211; removing greenery from gutters and walls, sweeping, litter-picking, bagging and disposing of ½ tonne of waste each time.</p>\n<p>We’ve made an impact. We are reclaiming ownership of our East Marsh. Recent twitter: “Those closest to the challenge have the greatest insights and the best solutions”; our Chief Inspector’s unprompted response: “Totally agree with this as @EastMarshUnited are proving”.</p>\n<p>And now we need funding. We started in the midst of a desperate situation. We now find ourselves with community spirit and a vision of hope. We want to build on this, bring in more ‘East Marshers’, develop and grow our community to make a substantial and sustainable difference. We need help to move towards our larger ideals, supporting a calendar year of projects:</p>\n<p>1. Develop EMU, directors and community members, by:<br />\na. Training. Bid-writing/funding, IT, basic project management.<br />\nb. Developing a community action plan.<br />\nc. Visits to/from other community groups across the UK<br />\n2. Reach out to ‘East Marshers’ by:<br />\na. Holding a Summer Fun Day and Consultation Event (July/August); residents can tell us about the future East Marsh, enjoy music, activities, food and drink.<br />\nb.

Once that has been cleared in the whole area, it should be relatively straightforward to simply pick up the litter on the streets, no need of the hoes and spades, so we&#8217;ll be getting through perhaps two or three streets in one shift &#8211; who knows perhaps more, perhaps all six&#8230;</p>\n<p>And we can then perhaps begin to look outward from the POWW and see if other groups of residents might want to come together and foster change in their little bit of the East Marsh. We&#8217;re also exploring solutions for those bigger fly-tipped items, wheelie bins and boarded up houses &#8211; these will take a little more time to set up, but&#8230; we are DETERMINED!</p>\n<p>To see the photos from Hildyard Street on Saturday &#8211; if you’re on the web, they’re to the right of this post, and our social media links with the photos are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/eastmarshunited/?hl=en\">https://www.instagram.com/eastmarshunited</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EastMarshUnited\">https://twitter.com/EastMarshUnited</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please do have a look, share, follow and/or come and join us cleaning Harold Street this Saturday 9.45am.

the sun shone down on us and the spirit of East Marsh United is really strong and is heartening. We are just people who live here and by doing this we are standing together and showing that we CARE. And it was great that people passing by stopped to say hello and residents came out of their houses to cheer us on. We also value the support we have from Paul (another East Marsher!) and the guys at the council. And we value the support we get from people who don&#8217;t want publicity for their generosity &#8211; business owners, retailers, council employees, labour party: you know who you are, so thanks!</p>\n<p>We took two minutes out yesterday to be silent and remember those killed in murderous wars. We all had our own private thoughts during this brief time of reflection and I found it extremely moving to stand with my fellow East Marshers. I thought about the Grimsby Chums and about those from Grimsby caught up in the mayhem out at sea, how the lives of people just like us were taken or damaged and it makes my resolve stronger than ever. I feel sure they would all have stood with us to make the world a better place.</p>\n<p>If a picture is worth a thousand words, here&#8217;s some from yesterday&#8217;s street clean &#8211; onwards!</p>\n<h2>Before&#8230;</h2>\n<div class=\"tiled-gallery type-square tiled-gallery-unresized\" data-original-width=\"500\" data-carousel-extra='{&quot;blog_id&quot;:133614333,&quot;permalink&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/eastmarshunited.org\\/2017\\/11\\/12\\/taking-back-our-streets-and-putting-smiles-on-peoples-faces\\/&quot;,&quot;likes_blog_id&quot;:133614333}' itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageGallery\" > <div class=\"gallery-row\" style=\"width: 500px;
