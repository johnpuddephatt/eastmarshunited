Friends and neighbours pulled out all the stops, baking cakes, running pine cone bird feeder and bug hotel workshops, staffing the stalls and milling around chatting to people.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Margaret the bumble bee took people on a tour of the garden, explaining the importance of pollination and telling children about her favorite flowers.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2245\" data-permalink=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/2024/10/13/ecoday-the-day-we-declared-our-community-garden-well-and-truly-open/img_6298/\" data-orig-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/img_6298.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1352,1948\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1727526666&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"IMG_6298\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/img_6298.jpg?w=208\" data-large-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/img_6298.jpg?w=711\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"711\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/img_6298.jpg?w=711\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2245\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Margaret the Bumble Bee</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We even had a poem written especially for the event, read by the poet himself, which looked back at the area when it was marshland, then looked at the present and towards the future when the community garden is fully flourishing. Keep your eye on our site for more news about that&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our aim is to make the garden a haven for wildlife. We&#8217;ve planted wildflowers too attract bees, bugs, butterflies and birds. Because it&#8217;s autumn, the plants are not all in flower in this season, so we had photographs on garden canes to show people how beautiful the flowers will be in spring and summer. Margaret liked the photos very much!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We were delighted to see people going home with bags full of apples, beans and herbs that they&#8217;d picked from the garden. It&#8217;s a community space and we want people to stop and pick the produce as they pass by.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Fancy joining us?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We have lots of plans for plants and would value your input!  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We meet at 1:30 every Thursday afternoon at St John and St Stephen&#8217;s on Roberts St. It would great to see you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The children enjoyed our eco day so much that we&#8217;re going to have a junior gardening club. The first meeting is during half term on Wednesday 23rd October, meeting at the church at the above address.

Problems still continued with this refurbished home but in a place that was out of sight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;The East Marsh has been grappling with a persistent and escalating issue: the state of its alleyways. These narrow, often overlooked passageways have become a breeding ground for waste and drug dealing, posing significant health and safety risks to residents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A recent incident involving a family&#8217;s home inundated with human waste is just one stark example of the problems plaguing the area. The family&#8217;s ordeal, which included multiple attempts to resolve the issue with the help of plumbers, a jetting company, and even Anglian Water, highlights the complex nature of the problem and the frustration of those affected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The alleyway in question had been a dumping ground for months, with East Marsh United, our contracting partners Expert Spray and residents reporting the issue to their local authority and local councillors on numerous occasions. Despite these efforts, the situation continued to deteriorate, culminating in the family&#8217;s distressing experience. After East Marsh United had reported an empty property to the Empty Homes team within the local authority, as the garden was stacked up with rubbish and their garden fence buckling under the weight of it into the alleyway, the rubbish was cleared by an unknown source<strong> into the alleyway</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"473\" height=\"1023\" data-attachment-id=\"2229\" data-permalink=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/whatsapp-image-2024-09-09-at-08-02-14_897ba8b9/\" data-orig-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/whatsapp-image-2024-09-09-at-08.02.14_897ba8b9.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"828,1792\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"WhatsApp Image 2024-09-09 at 08.02.14_897ba8b9\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/whatsapp-image-2024-09-09-at-08.02.14_897ba8b9.jpg?w=139\" data-large-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/whatsapp-image-2024-09-09-at-08.02.14_897ba8b9.jpg?w=473\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-id=\"2229\" src=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/whatsapp-image-2024-09-09-at-08.02.14_897ba8b9.jpg?w=473\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2229\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"473\" height=\"1023\" data-attachment-id=\"2228\" data-permalink=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/whatsapp-image-2024-09-09-at-08-02-13_0f475f04/\" data-orig-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/whatsapp-image-2024-09-09-at-08.02.13_0f475f04.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"828,1792\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"WhatsApp Image 2024-09-09 at 08.02.13_0f475f04\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/whatsapp-image-2024-09-09-at-08.02.13_0f475f04.jpg?w=139\" data-large-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/whatsapp-image-2024-09-09-at-08.02.13_0f475f04.jpg?w=473\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-id=\"2228\" src=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/whatsapp-image-2024-09-09-at-08.02.13_0f475f04.jpg?w=473\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2228\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The Stinking Mess in the AlleyWay</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"473\" height=\"1023\" data-attachment-id=\"2225\" data-permalink=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/alleyway-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/alleyway-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"828,1792\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Alleyway 1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/alleyway-1.jpg?w=139\" data-large-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/alleyway-1.jpg?w=473\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-id=\"2225\" src=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/alleyway-1.jpg?w=473\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2225\" /></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>East Marsh United is an ethical landlord and when one of our tenants reported the issue they were having on a Friday, we had no choice but to step in and clear the alleyway. The scale of the problem became even more apparent. The waste removed included a shocking range of items, from asbestos and human waste to mattresses, drugs paraphernalia, and even children&#8217;s toys. The sheer volume of waste, coupled with its hazardous nature, posed a serious threat to the health and safety of the entire community. The cost to East Marsh United was over £3k (yup, three <strong>thousand </strong>pounds), along with two days of manpower on a Saturday and Sunday by Expert Spray and a waste disposal team. The issue of sewage waste coming up in gardens and toilets being unable to be flushed, wasn’t just problematic for our tenant, but other residents in the street.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"473\" height=\"1023\" data-attachment-id=\"2226\" data-permalink=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/alleyway-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/alleyway-2.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"828,1792\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Alleyway 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/alleyway-2.jpg?w=139\" data-large-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/alleyway-2.jpg?w=473\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-id=\"2226\" src=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/alleyway-2.jpg?w=473\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2226\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"473\" height=\"1023\" data-attachment-id=\"2227\" data-permalink=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/alleyway-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/alleyway-3.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"828,1792\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Alleyway 3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/alleyway-3.jpg?w=139\" data-large-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/alleyway-3.jpg?w=473\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-id=\"2227\" src=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/alleyway-3.jpg?w=473\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2227\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Hard Graft and £3K later&#8230;</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The incident serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need for a coordinated approach to address the ongoing issues with alleyways in the East Marsh. Partnership working between residents, landlords, councillors, and the local authority is essential to finding sustainable solutions. Simply saying ‘the alleyways belong to the landlords or home owners’, although technically correct, is not helpful and cannot be the answer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The issue of waste in alleyways is not a one-time occurrence but a longstanding problem that requires ongoing attention so we can find a permanent solution. Effective solutions will require collaboration between all stakeholders, including residents, landlords, councillors, and the local authority. The financial burden of clearing up waste and addressing infrastructure issues is significant, both for individuals and the community as a whole.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the East Marsh community continues to advocate for improvements, it is hoped that this incident will serve as a catalyst for change. By working together, residents and authorities can create a cleaner, safer, and more pleasant environment for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n","<p>Paula Graves, Community-Led Housing Manager This follows on from a blog I wrote back in August about the issues that are encountered when properties are left empty for such a long time.

One</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>East Marsh United had ambitious plans to transform this eyesore into an Eco Exemplar home. A local organisation had generously donated an air source heat pump, and solar panels and external wall insulation were on the agenda. This project held the promise of demonstrating that existing homes, not just new builds, can be retrofitted to be environmentally friendly and energy efficient. It was to be EMU’s show home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial dream of an eco-home was dashed when a partnership fell through with a funder, leaving EMU to shoulder the entire financial burden. The house was in a far worse condition than anticipated, with structural issues that consumed the £15,000 grant from North East Lincolnshire Council (NELC) and the rest of the money from our own funds, we embarked on a Herculean task. The dream of an Eco Exemplar had to be scaled back, a painful decision given the potential benefits to the environment and the future residents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This project highlights a critical issue: the urgent need for increased investment in the retrofitting of older homes. Properties built in the early 1900s, often home to low-income families, are energy guzzlers. Soaring energy costs place an immense burden on these households, trapping them in a cycle of poverty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the overwhelming challenges, we persevered. The house was reborn as a three-bedroom haven with modern amenities. Eco-friendly features like lime render, &#8216;A&#8217; rated appliances, and top-notch insulation were incorporated to create a sustainable and comfortable living space.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-4 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" data-attachment-id=\"2204\" data-permalink=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/2024/08/21/from-derelict-to-dream-home-the-battle-to-bring-an-empty-house-back-to-life-on-grimsbys-east-marsh/bathroom-heaven/\" data-orig-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/bathroom-heaven.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1200,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Bathroom Heaven\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/bathroom-heaven.jpg?w=225\" data-large-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/bathroom-heaven.jpg?w=768\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-id=\"2204\" src=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/bathroom-heaven.jpg?w=768\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2204\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Bathroom Heaven</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" data-attachment-id=\"2205\" data-permalink=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/2024/08/21/from-derelict-to-dream-home-the-battle-to-bring-an-empty-house-back-to-life-on-grimsbys-east-marsh/kitchen-to-paradise/\" data-orig-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/kitchen-to-paradise.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1200,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Kitchen to Paradise\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/kitchen-to-paradise.jpg?w=225\" data-large-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/kitchen-to-paradise.jpg?w=768\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-id=\"2205\" src=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/kitchen-to-paradise.jpg?w=768\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2205\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Kitchen Paradise</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" data-attachment-id=\"2206\" data-permalink=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/2024/08/21/from-derelict-to-dream-home-the-battle-to-bring-an-empty-house-back-to-life-on-grimsbys-east-marsh/landing-to-luxury/\" data-orig-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/landing-to-luxury.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1200,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Landing to Luxury\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/landing-to-luxury.jpg?w=225\" data-large-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/landing-to-luxury.jpg?w=768\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-id=\"2206\" src=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/landing-to-luxury.jpg?w=768\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2206\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Landing to Luxury</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">However, the journey was far from smooth. The £15,000 grant, although helpful, barely covered the essential structural work needed to make the house safe and habitable. The reality is that bringing an empty property back to life is a costly and time-consuming endeavour.The financial burden of this home was significant. The property itself was purchased for £31,500, which was double its market value given its derelict state. The refurbishment costs then soared to over £100,000. To put this in perspective, the average house price in East Marsh is just £64,000. In total, EMU has spent a staggering <strong>117.97%</strong> over this average house price to bring this empty property back to life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>EMU&#8217;s experience is a stark reminder that turning derelict properties into habitable homes is a complex and costly endeavour. While we have successfully transformed this derelict house into a home for a deserving tenant, our experience highlights the urgent need for increased support from local authorities and funders. Empty properties are a blight on communities and a wasted resource.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To truly address the issues of empty homes and energy poverty, we need a multifaceted approach. This includes increased funding for property renovation, support for community-led initiatives, and policies that incentivize the retrofitting of older homes.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>East Marsh United&#8217;s efforts are a beacon of hope, demonstrating what can be achieved with determination and community spirit.

David says: When I first got into Bowie in the late 70s, I&#8217;d never heard anything like the instrumentals on side two of &#8216;Low&#8217; and &#8216;Heroes&#8217;. They led me to Eno and Eno led me to more experimental German music, the name Stockhausen kept coming up. I then got heavily into the avant-garde, the Boulez, Stockhausen, pulled back a bit and then sort of found my voice as a composer. So it all started with those two Berlin albums of Bowie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was why I wanted to do the project with the Deltas (<a href=\"https://www.deltasax.com/\">The Delta Saxophone Quartet</a>). Doing things like Art Decade or Warszawa in a classical context because It seemed to me that if they could be a gateway for me, they could for somebody else as well and the Deltas then took up the baton and ran with it, got other arrangements from other people and with the end result of the CD. Here&#8217;s a piece that you might recognise from the <a href=\"https://davidpowercomposer.bigcartel.com/product/bowie-berlin-and-beyond\">Bowie, Berlin and Beyond</a> album:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VNkkOIcvyh8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent&#038;listType=playlist&#038;list=PLgf-6VyIkpHNDAXZ9fsVs2NPCaC1ymbNk\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n</div><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Heroes by the Delta Saxophone Quartet</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I asked David about something I&#8217;d read online about him, that he&#8217;d had a creative crisis &#8211; could he share something of that and how he found his way past it? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, the next step after finding the really experimental rock stuff is I got into the really experimental contemporary classical stuff. I didn&#8217;t even know there was such a thing as contemporary classical. People like Boulez, Stockhausen and Varese. And It seemed at the end of a journey. So I started writing in that style. But it wasn&#8217;t right for me. And then I found myself writing music that sort of fell between two stools that wasn&#8217;t very expressive. Like when you&#8217;re trying to be something you&#8217;re not almost so, in the end, I decided to write some piano music that wouldn&#8217;t be performed and the idea was to see what happened if I took all external expectations away. I suppose I created a safe space for myself. The first one came out. Very like a Prokofiev piece, so I thought, oh, this isn&#8217;t so good. The second one which didn&#8217;t make the final cut because it simply wasn&#8217;t good enough. Then I wrote the one that is the current number two in the set which came to be known as Miniatures:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rM7T4Nekt84?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n</div><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Miniatures #2 from Eight Miniatures for Piano, composed and played by David Power</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The singular, ethereal piece of music above appears on an album called <a href=\"https://davidpowercomposer.bigcartel.com/product/100-years-of-british-piano-miniatures\">100 years of British Piano Miniatures</a>, which puts David in the same honoured space as Arthur Butterworth, student of Ralph Vaughan Williams. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I&#8217;d written it I thought this this is the best thing I&#8217;ve ever written. And it&#8217;s the simplest thing I&#8217;ve ever written. It is literally a grade one piece. It is so simple. But it was recorded on a CD called 100 Years of British piano Miniatures, which has done very well online &#8211;  on Spotify, it&#8217;s got nearly two million streams. This helps to get over the barrier with classical music. The internet enables you to get around it because people don&#8217;t think, oh, we&#8217;ll skip this track. It&#8217;s classical music.

Just a poor boy from a poor family!</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">From the panto’s resident cook, Mike Parker (and, don&#8217;t tell anybody, but Mike is the wonderfully talented scriptwriter, too&#8230;)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rewind to September last year, when my wife spoke to me about the possibility of us creating a community pantomime.  By no means am I a professional performer but I had already signed up for 6 shows before Christmas but, this was an opportunity too good to turn down. A couple weeks later we have a meeting. There was nothing but laughter and ideas bubbling away from everybody.  It was then that I was asked to join in with the writing process. I was honoured. If you have not heard some of the talented east marsh writers at the &#8220;happenings&#8221; , which is basically a showcase for some amazing local writers, performers musicians and basically anybody who is anybody to show their talent, then I urge you to go to the next one. To be included in this circle humbled me, and by the next day , 4 pages of script were pretty much done. Myself, Carolyn Doyley and Paul Haddock then had a brainstorming session over a brew and a bacon sarnie with Carolyn storyboarding the play, and Paul throwing ideas and lines in as well. I then produced more of the story including what we had discussed. After posting off, I realised I must have done a good job as I was asked to produce a full working script.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"596\" height=\"1024\" data-attachment-id=\"2115\" data-permalink=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/chorrats2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/chorrats2.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"3504,6024\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Gordon Wilson&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS 250D&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;no unauthorised use&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;24&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;1600&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.016666666666667&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"ChorRats2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/chorrats2.jpg?w=175\" data-large-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/chorrats2.jpg?w=596\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/chorrats2.jpg?w=596\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2115\" srcset=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/chorrats2.jpg?w=596 596w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/chorrats2.jpg?w=1192 1192w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/chorrats2.jpg?w=87 87w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/chorrats2.jpg?w=175 175w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/chorrats2.jpg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Photo by Gordon Wilson</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We meet in November, with a relatively accurate idea of the final script and casting. The read through was a success as a whole and changes to script and cast were made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowing that I was in safe hands with Vikki, my gorgeous wife playing the lead and the reliable as ever Josie Moon looking after us all was of great comfort to me but the incoming John Mooney as a director worried me. John was an accomplished performer. Would my script be good enough? Would he want to tear it up. And start again? I needn&#8217;t have worried.&nbsp; We were in very safe hands with John bringing his wealth of experience to the table, whilst not being so arrogant as to not listen to ideas from any members of this group, including the kids. More than abley assisted by Josie, who without her knowing, was now mum to the group. We were now on our way to making a panto.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>December became poorly season and it was then, one night walking in on Tuesday night, and finding a few long faces and to be honest, tears. We&#8217;d not had a full rehearsal together because of illness and Christmas commitments.&nbsp; After a get together it was decided to postpone until after Christmas.&nbsp; Definitely the right decision.&nbsp; Cast members that couldn&#8217;t be in the performance now could and the choir could now practice panto songs after working so hard on their Christmas performances.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meeting up after a Christmas break, it seemed that we had to start all over again but after a couple of weeks everything was starting to get embedded into people&#8217;s memories. Rehearsals were more structured,&nbsp; intense and dare I say professional. What I mean by that is that quite a few of this cast, whether part of the choir,&nbsp; primary cast and kids had never done this before. But the commitment and love for this project was there for all to see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We definitely had something special.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"703\" height=\"1023\" data-attachment-id=\"2116\" data-permalink=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/cryer2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cryer2.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"4020,5852\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Gordon Wilson&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS 250D&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;no unauthorised use&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;24&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;2000&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.0125&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Cryer2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cryer2.jpg?w=206\" data-large-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cryer2.jpg?w=703\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cryer2.jpg?w=703\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2116\" srcset=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cryer2.jpg?w=703 703w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cryer2.jpg?w=1406 1406w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cryer2.jpg?w=103 103w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cryer2.jpg?w=206 206w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cryer2.jpg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 703px) 100vw, 703px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Photo by Gordon Wilson</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Cometh show week, Cometh the crisis. The band that had been eagerly anticipated had dwindled gradually away to be replaced by a bloke on a keyboard. The lighting guy had not had chance to set up his full rig as the room was in constant use so the first time that we could practice lighting cues was Wednesday.  Again no need to worry as a certain Jack Pudsey and his daughter, Layla were on the ball and within 2 hours, everything set up and lighting was not an issue. It was then told to us that the stage we had to set up would have to be taken down and reassembled, the day before. Aaaaaarrrrrrrggghhh!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, enter a keyboard player called Steve who played our songs better in some songs than the actual originals! Improvising incidental music and bridging the gaps in between scenes and wardrobe changes. Wow. Just wow!!! The final piece is here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We now definitely have a panto.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"890\" height=\"1023\" data-attachment-id=\"2114\" data-permalink=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/ch12/\" data-orig-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ch12.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"3934,4525\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Gordon Wilson&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS 250D&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;no unauthorised use&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;24&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;2000&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.016666666666667&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Ch12\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ch12.jpg?w=261\" data-large-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ch12.jpg?w=890\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ch12.jpg?w=890\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2114\" srcset=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ch12.jpg?w=890 890w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ch12.jpg?w=1780 1780w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ch12.jpg?w=130 130w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ch12.jpg?w=261 261w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ch12.jpg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 890px) 100vw, 890px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Photo by Gordon Wilson</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Dress rehearsal happens and we fluff a few cues and lines, including me.and I wrote the thing! Nerves are setting in a little uncertainty.&nbsp; Can we do this? We have had 2 months rehearsal and some people have never been in a performance like this. Still, I reckon we can. In fact. I know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Show day is here and most of the cast are at the venue for 3pm, ready for 6pm doors open. In that time we have to assemble the seating. Return the lighting stands to their original positions and if need be, reassemble the stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately,&nbsp; upon arrival we were greeted by the unbelievable stench of raw sewage. Yes. We could make a panto based on the making of the panto!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decisions have to be made so the whole seating area of 75 chairs, set lighting, props, clothing. Yes, everything had to be moved. Tempers were starting to flare and I was definitely in that category. But, eventually things look great and the room actually looked better than the original room that it should have been in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still nervy and very tense we get to showtime. I mentioned that our Dick Whittington was played by my amazing wife Vikki. The choir was in full song and then enters Vikki to sing her solo. I could tell she was nervous but the crowd loved her. Song finishes and Sue, also taking up her role last minute as the town cryer made it her own. Whilst only a short role, mainly because her principal role as musical director was choosing, arranging and bringing to life the songs which she went above and beyond. And it showed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our resident hecklers and a rather significant script change were Billy and Dan. Our 2 fishermen that heckled their way into narrating the story. Again, these guys were not in from the beginning but you wouldn&#8217;t have known. They had the crowd hanging off their every word. And their comic timing was impeccable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We then meet Dorothy played by Kelly. A twist on the script that went down well with the audience.&nbsp; Kelly had also not had much time to prepare but bravely endeared herself to the audience, to then return to our amazing choir.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My time to shine was greeted with laughter at a 20 stone man plastered in make up wearing a dress. To be honest, I didn’t have to utter a word to get a laugh but I loved every minute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The dashing Fitzwarren enters suggesting with such a pan face, the lyrics to YMCA before the choir enthusiastically join in with the song. My son, Alfie, not normally into am-dram played this part purely to support family. You’ve probably gathered now that I’m a proud Dad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alice then enters the stage played by my daughter Kayleigh to give me a severe telling off. She’s on the bill as Dick’s love interest. Bit weird. Her mum is playing &nbsp;the role of Dick!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Family connection becomes more emotional for myself as it is suggested that Dick shines shoes for the audience as the shoe shining kit used belonged to my late grandfather. He was a night porter in the 1960’s at the Kingsway hotel and these were his tools of his trade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More emotion from now exploding with pride Dad as Mouser the cat enters the stage. Played by Brooke. She made everyone fall in love with I challenge anyone not to have a tear in their eye with her goodbye scene and rendition of “You’ve got a Friend in Me.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The villain enters in the form of John as King Rat, with his awesomely talented mini gangster rats and their breakdancing talents. John hypnotised the audience as per the script and made his alter ego a believable, nasty super villain. For the record. John is actually quite lovely and in his other role as director, brought all of our insane and impossible ideas to life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our Sea captain enters, fully equipped with boat, sail, rubber ring, pipe cap, jumper. Think that’s everything. If ever there was a perfect fit for this role, it was Andy, our more than able bodied captain. Guiding half of the cast to Bohemia, aided by the actions, and singing of Dick, Alice and the audience to “My Bonnie”, he had his work cut out. There would never need to be an audition for Andy. He was perfect for this part.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"683\" height=\"1023\" data-attachment-id=\"2113\" data-permalink=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/cap2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cap2.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1851,2774\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Gordon Wilson&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS 250D&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;no unauthorised use&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;24&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;6400&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.02&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Cap2&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Cap2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cap2.jpg?w=200\" data-large-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cap2.jpg?w=683\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cap2.jpg?w=683\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2113\" srcset=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cap2.jpg?w=683 683w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cap2.jpg?w=1366 1366w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cap2.jpg?w=100 100w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cap2.jpg?w=200 200w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cap2.jpg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Photo by Gordon Wilson</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We get to see Paul and Carolyn as the King and Queen of Bohemia before a quick costume change where they are summoned by our beautiful fairy played by Rachel who, with a stroke of magic has transformed them into the pearly King and Queen. I keep gushing about performances but genuinely, here were another three people who are normally attendees of our peace choir but performed in these roles because they were asked to help make our panto work. And yes, of course they were amazing!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A return of King rat results in a daring swordfight ending with a gunshot, but only in the foot meaning that King Rat gets arrested by none other than our Julia. Another member of our choir that we sort of bullied into the role! Juila was very anxious about whether she would succeed but anyone that saw her in the show would have realised that she needn’t have been anxious at all. Same for Emma, who likes to hide at the back but proved that&#8217;s she&#8217;s as much of a trooper as everyone else. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course we get our happy ending, bows taken, applause and a general sense of pride in what we have achieved. A group of people, all from different backgrounds, acting abilities and different ways of life, all sharing in one common goal. To deliver the best performance that they can to raise as many smiles as they can.

Perhaps that is something to do with getting older, or having had a fast-paced and exciting year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of 2022, EMU was facing a somewhat stark year ahead, with uncertainty about funding and being able to retain the talented staff who were working at full tilt to keep the project going. The decision was that if funding support didn’t arrive in 2023 then there would be no choice other than to scale back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As 2023 has progressed, the ship has become more secure, with funds and support arriving from different places to guarantee projects, salaries and a level of stability that is welcome after a long period of uncertainty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, nothing is ever certain for long. Our lives are characterised by constant flux and change.&nbsp; It is a dangerous myth to ever think that anything is truly ‘sorted’. But for now we can allow ourselves a breathing space to think, plan and make the best use of the good support and resources we have secured.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That leads me on to thinking about the character of this particular time of year, the season of darkness and cold when nature sleeps and many of us struggle to have much energy or enthusiasm for anything beyond being cosy at home. Let me tell you a secret; that desire for snuggling at home is a perfectly normal and natural response to the winter.&nbsp; We are, after all, animals, part of the natural world and our deep, primal instincts are centuries old. Now <em>is </em>the time to withdraw to the furthest, safest and snuggest corner of the cave. Now<em> is </em>the time to rest, dream and let the year go into the past while the promise of the New Year gradually dawns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At EMU, we are celebrating our Mid-Winter, the Solstice, that time of shortest day and longest night, with songs and company as the afternoon light drops into darkness on Friday 22<sup>nd</sup> December. We will share some food and warm drinks, wish each other well and head into our own festivities, however we celebrate them.&nbsp; Our team will take a well-earned rest over the festive days, hopefully being cosy and content, dreaming well and dozing in the darkness while Christmas lights twinkle and keep that sense of hope and joy alive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know this season can be very tough. We are acutely aware of the challenges faced by those who don’t have the means to celebrate, for those without a cosy home and we hold our righteous anger and compassion in our hearts for those people, and a determination that we will continue to work for a fairer, kinder and more hopeful community for everyone to enjoy.&nbsp; By taking some time to restore ourselves, to rest and be quiet, we know we will return in the New Year with the right energy to pick up the work and continue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever your plans, circumstances and hopes are at this time of year, the EMU team wish you peace, rest and comfort. We thank everyone who has walked the path of this year alongside us and we look forward to continuing our journey in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With love and light.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>Let there be rest.

This time, however, we knew we couldn&#8217;t do it alone, so we called on the people in the street to come and join us.

The Together for Childhood gang swung into action and created a space in the street with all kinds of toys and games and it was like lighting a firework, standing back and watching the beautiful display. The kids were just joyous and clearly enjoyed their new-found freedom. On the face of it, a simple thing to do but we built neighbourhood bonds, fostered active and happy kids, and I knew when I saw the kids scootering and cycling up and down the car-free street, their sense of independence was being nurtured. It was actually quite emotional to see the growing sense of freedom in the beautiful chaos of children&#8217;s play &#8211; and hats off to the NSPCC Together for Childhood team who facilitated the play in such a gentle and encouraging way, everybody felt they could come along and join in &#8211; and they did!</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"819\" height=\"1023\" data-attachment-id=\"2071\" data-permalink=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/img_20231014_204819_522/\" data-orig-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_20231014_204819_522.webp\" data-orig-size=\"1080,1350\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"IMG_20231014_204819_522\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_20231014_204819_522.webp?w=240\" data-large-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_20231014_204819_522.webp?w=819\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_20231014_204819_522.webp?w=819\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2071\" style=\"width:192px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_20231014_204819_522.webp?w=819 819w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_20231014_204819_522.webp?w=120 120w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_20231014_204819_522.webp?w=240 240w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_20231014_204819_522.webp?w=768 768w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_20231014_204819_522.webp 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>And to cap it all, the brilliant actor, the East Marsh&#8217;s own Thomas Turgoose, came to visit and say hi to us all, and the Grimsby Town Foundation came along with goalposts, nets and footballs, so we had street football, livened by a great big fire truck sounding its siren and letting the kids in to the wagon to have a good look around at it &#8211; glorious! &#8211; there were even free tickets to yesterday&#8217;s Town Match that a good few people made good use of (result notwithstanding&#8230;).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we cleaned the street, repaired homes, removed rubbish, connected with people about benefits and welfare advice, people were listened to and we all had fun together &#8211; it was something magical! Our Six Feet of Your Street  day of action offered a real vision of what is possible for people living in the street and not accepting things as they are. When things are left in a mess, the mess increases and unloved streets bring nothing but trouble. Yesterday we worked with our neighbours and friends and showed how there is real hope out there to tackle the bigger challenges if we all stand together. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>It was a really wonderful day.

There were so many people from our community and from groups and organisations from right across the town, and together we brought new growth to our East Marsh!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the morning, pupils joined us from primary schools across the East Marsh. This included children from Weelsby Primary, St Mary&#8217;s Catholic Primary, Strand Primary, William Barcroft Primary, Grant Thorold Forest, Havelock Academy and Phoenix House. They made an aboslute fantastic start, thanks to the help and guidance of the incredible Create Streets Foundation (who helped make all this happen) and expert arboriculturist, Russell Horsey.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"embed-vimeo\"><iframe title=\"2023-02-09 Tree Planting in the Park - Look North.mp4\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/798542609?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"500\" height=\"283\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\"></iframe></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Later in the afternoon, we opened up the tree planting to people from the wider community. We had a quite a few special guests make an appearance, including Grimsby’s MP, Lia Nici, and the Mayor – who both cut ceremonial ribbons to mark the planting of the trees. Other local councillors were there too, along with Nicholas Boys Smith, chair of the advisory board of the Government’s Office of Place. Harry Clifton and Shaun Pearson of Grimsby Town FC also came by to show their support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We planted several species of trees, including elms, tulip trees, sweetgums, red maples and sweet chestnuts. The new trees are 7 or 8 years old and around 4 to 5 metres tall, making them the right age and size to plant and thrive. Not only will the new trees make the park a more vibrant place for local residents to spend time, it’s also a chance for the next generation to learn about the importance of nature.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"786\" height=\"1024\" data-attachment-id=\"1911\" data-permalink=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/2023/02/13/our-tree-planting-day-in-grant-thorold-park-was-a-huge-success/img_9981/\" data-orig-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/img_9981.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1151,1500\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"img_9981\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/img_9981.jpg?w=230\" data-large-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/img_9981.jpg?w=786\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/img_9981.jpg?w=786\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1911\" srcset=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/img_9981.jpg?w=786 786w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/img_9981.jpg?w=115 115w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/img_9981.jpg?w=230 230w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/img_9981.jpg?w=768 768w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/img_9981.jpg 1151w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 786px) 100vw, 786px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We made sure all the volunteers were given a proper tree planting demo before they got stuck in. They were taught how to place the trees in the ground, install stakes and strimmer guards, and tidy up the soil. We also made sure refreshments and hot drinks were available in the nearby St John, St Stephen &amp; Shalom church.<br><br>It was such a phenomenal, heartwarming day. Some people were there to plant trees in honour of their loved ones; others were there simply because they care about their local park. Members of Humberside Fire &amp; Rescue Service came along to give the new trees a good watering, and the team from Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust were also on hand to captivate the school children with bark rubbing, nature trails and a hands-on nature table. The East Marsh Peace Choir was also out in full force to provide some inspirational background music!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" data-attachment-id=\"1909\" data-permalink=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/2023/02/13/our-tree-planting-day-in-grant-thorold-park-was-a-huge-success/foh5japxwaideqd/\" data-orig-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/foh5japxwaideqd.jpeg\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1536\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"foh5japxwaideqd\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/foh5japxwaideqd.jpeg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/foh5japxwaideqd.jpeg?w=1024\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/foh5japxwaideqd.jpeg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1909\" srcset=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/foh5japxwaideqd.jpeg?w=1024 1024w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/foh5japxwaideqd.jpeg 2048w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/foh5japxwaideqd.jpeg?w=150 150w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/foh5japxwaideqd.jpeg?w=300 300w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/foh5japxwaideqd.jpeg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve been giving local businesses have the chance to get in on the action by sponsoring the trees. For £500, they’ll have their name displayed on a new interactive digital map, with all proceeds going towards future greening of the area. Several local institutions have already pledged to sponsor a tree, including Grimsby Town Football Club and The Grimsby Institute.&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://sponsor-tree.paperform.co\" target=\"_blank\">If you know anyone who would be interested in spon</a><a href=\"https://sponsor-tree.paperform.co\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">s</a><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://sponsor-tree.paperform.co\" target=\"_blank\">oring a tree, point them here</a>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our local garden centres also showed their community spirit with their generous donations. Pennells of Grimsby added a splash of colour by donating four trays of dwarf daffodils and miniature irises. Grimsby Garden Centre also kindly sponsored a tree and delivered one of their ‘Happy to Chat’ benches, designed specifically to get people talking.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"586\" data-attachment-id=\"1901\" data-permalink=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/2023/02/13/our-tree-planting-day-in-grant-thorold-park-was-a-huge-success/bench-mp-lia-nici-cropped/\" data-orig-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/bench-mp-lia-nici-cropped.jpeg\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1173\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"bench-mp-lia-nici-cropped\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/bench-mp-lia-nici-cropped.jpeg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/bench-mp-lia-nici-cropped.jpeg?w=1024\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/bench-mp-lia-nici-cropped.jpeg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1901\" srcset=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/bench-mp-lia-nici-cropped.jpeg?w=1024 1024w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/bench-mp-lia-nici-cropped.jpeg?w=2046 2046w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/bench-mp-lia-nici-cropped.jpeg?w=150 150w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/bench-mp-lia-nici-cropped.jpeg?w=300 300w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/bench-mp-lia-nici-cropped.jpeg?w=768 768w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/bench-mp-lia-nici-cropped.jpeg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><br>This tree planting day was all part of our grand vision for &#8216;Greening the Marsh’ – we plan to plant a further thirty trees next year. The whole thing has been facilitated by Create Streets Foundation a charity supporting urban design research, neighbourhood planning and community-led design across the UK. The next step is to plant trees all the way down Rutland Street and across Cleethorpes Road, all of which will help make the area calmer and more pleasant.

The process involves carefully placing trees in the ground, installing stakes and strimmer guards, and tidying up the soil.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the day, we’ll also be firming up plans to water and look after the trees on a long term basis, as well as looking at other exciting plans for greening up the East Marsh. Refreshments, hot drinks and toilet facilities will be available in the nearby St John, St Stephen &amp; Shalom church.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also want to recognise the emotional significance trees have in our lives. Often living for many, many years, trees are there at specific milestones in our lives, and can be used to commemorate the lives of loved ones no longer with us.

These are some of the conversations we had and some of the things we are doing to build a brighter future for the East Marsh.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bringing the good people of the East Marsh together</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Josie Moon, East Marsh resident,&nbsp; “We had been out for the evening and got back to see the police cars across the street on the next block &#8211; and there were people out chatting on their fronts, everybody was very calm &#8211; people were like ‘shit happens but we’re all alright’. Seeing people out on the street and talking to each other, we need to do that more. But, to refer to a street as ‘Murder Mile’ demonises the residents and undermines community cohesion &#8211; it’s our street, our home, together.”</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>EMU host regular ‘kitchen table’ events where people just turn up and sit with each other for a few hours, simply being in each other’s company &#8211; and perhaps have a laugh about living on ‘murder mile’.&nbsp; We also host the East Marsh Peace Choir most weeks, where we are often deeply moved by the simple act of singing together.&nbsp;</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Improving our homes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Rev Kay Jones “It starts with the housing &#8211; if people feel secure in their home and know that they have neighbours who care and landlords that care, then there’s security. What EMU (East Marsh United) are doing to change the housing balance will bring a better heart to everything. And then you have to think about this (EMU picking up litter together in our park on Saturday morning) &#8211; people who probably otherwise wouldn’t get together. But, we’re together because we all care about the park and what goes on in our neighbourhood. The possibility of bad things happening is reduced by the presence of good people, which also helps build positivity in the community.”</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>EMU have bought three houses in Rutland Street, completely refurbished, everything new, and we stand with our tenants as an ethical community landlord. We raised £500,000 in the summer to buy more houses and aim to buy ‘100 Houses for 100 Years’ maintaining community owned housing for generations to come, for our children and our children’s children.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Making our neighbourhood cleaner and greener&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Community Artist, Sarah Palmer: “I spend a lot of time working on the East Marsh and there’s a lot of really positive things that get under-reported or overlooked. The kind of reporting here doesn’t do the town any good because people from outside the area won’t want to visit &#8211; and look at all these people, these kids, out on a wet and windy Saturday morning coming out to clean their park because they care about it.”</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>East Marsh United (EMU) are working to help people become stewards of our neighbourhood by meeting regularly and cleaning up our park. We now have the support of the Council, Create Streets, Cadent Gas and the Urban Street Tree Challenge Fund to plant 30 new trees in the park and a further 30 along Rutland Street. As part of this new Greening Up East Grimbsy initiative we will be holding a community greening up day in January, asking the community to choose types of trees, bid for locations and get stuck in with the digging. Not only will new trees brighten up the environment for all those living in East Grimsby they will also help reduce speeds along Rutland Street&nbsp;</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Community Wealth Building &#8211; coming together to sort out our problems&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Terry Evans lives a few doors away from the site of the incident and says “It was a one-off, you get trouble on the street, but nothing like that &#8211; and I don’t know anybody round here who is particularly concerned about it. The article gave the whole street a bad name, residents a bad name. ‘Murder Mile’? It’s new to me, it’s absolutely ridiculous and gives people the wrong impression &#8211; it’s nowhere near that bad. East Marsh United are trying to bring people together to understand the problems and sort the problems out ourselves as nobody else seems to know how to.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>EMU are working with friends from community groups, business, politics and academia to promote Community Wealth Building across Grimsby through projects in housing and employment but also what we’ve called ‘The Coming Generation’, promoting the unheard voices of young people and trying to create a place where young people feel secure and want to stay and make a contribution to their town. We also have good relationships with our schools, working with kids in park visits and on projects such as the wonderful East Marsh Anthem.</em>&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"497\" data-attachment-id=\"1846\" data-permalink=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/2022/11/01/murder-mile-no-thanks-east-marsh-united-are-building-a-better-future-for-generations-to-come/emu-community-singalong-the-day-after-the-drive-by-shooting/\" data-orig-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/emu-community-singalong-the-day-after-the-drive-by-shooting.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"4032,1960\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;1.5&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;SM-G960F&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1666990621&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;4.3&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;320&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"emu-community-singalong-the-day-after-the-drive-by-shooting\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/emu-community-singalong-the-day-after-the-drive-by-shooting.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/emu-community-singalong-the-day-after-the-drive-by-shooting.jpg?w=1024\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/emu-community-singalong-the-day-after-the-drive-by-shooting.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1846\" srcset=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/emu-community-singalong-the-day-after-the-drive-by-shooting.jpg?w=1022 1022w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/emu-community-singalong-the-day-after-the-drive-by-shooting.jpg?w=2045 2045w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/emu-community-singalong-the-day-after-the-drive-by-shooting.jpg?w=150 150w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/emu-community-singalong-the-day-after-the-drive-by-shooting.jpg?w=300 300w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/emu-community-singalong-the-day-after-the-drive-by-shooting.jpg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">EMU Community singalong the day after the &#8216;drive-by shooting&#8217;</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The night after the ‘drive-by shooting, EMU hosted ‘The Happening’ at Freeman Street Market.&nbsp; Around 60 people came along, from age 5 to 80 to share songs, poems and to be together for an evening of joyful, creative celebration.

The family is visited by a man calling himself Inspector Goole, who questions the family about the suicide of a young working-class woman in her mid-twenties.

I’m also a life-long calligrapher. These are all things that now influence my work and style. I work in sketchbooks, and paint and create every single day.

I’ve had it for around six years, when my son was then three. He gave the chalet its name, and it stuck! So when I came to set my art business up in September 2020 it made sense to name it after the chalet, as so much of my work is based around that area of the coast.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"604\" height=\"845\" data-attachment-id=\"1619\" data-permalink=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/eight-foot/\" data-orig-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/eight-foot.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1772,2480\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"eight foot\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/eight-foot.jpg?w=214\" data-large-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/eight-foot.jpg?w=732\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/eight-foot.jpg?w=604\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1619\" srcset=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/eight-foot.jpg?w=604 604w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/eight-foot.jpg?w=1208 1208w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/eight-foot.jpg?w=107 107w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/eight-foot.jpg?w=214 214w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/eight-foot.jpg?w=768 768w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/eight-foot.jpg?w=732 732w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px\" /><figcaption>Eight Foot</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" type=\"1\" start=\"3\"><li><strong>What does art mean to you?&nbsp;</strong></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>It feeds my soul.

I have a constant list of them! I’ve been asked to create some artwork for the round window in Cleethorpes Library, and I’m working towards creating some materials to protect and promote the heritage of the Humberston Fitties. I’d also like to highlight the architectural heritage of the area around Freeman Street. I also want to create a book around H.C. Scaping as his buildings are to be found all over Grimsby. I have a particular love for buildings! If I didn’t have to work, I’d love to travel around the UK by train, and simply spend all day sketching what I saw on my travels!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"604\" height=\"862\" data-attachment-id=\"1618\" data-permalink=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/alexandra-dock-towards-townetsy/\" data-orig-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/alexandra-dock-towards-townetsy.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2480,3543\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"alexandra dock towards townetsy\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/alexandra-dock-towards-townetsy.jpg?w=210\" data-large-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/alexandra-dock-towards-townetsy.jpg?w=717\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/alexandra-dock-towards-townetsy.jpg?w=604\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1618\" srcset=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/alexandra-dock-towards-townetsy.jpg?w=604 604w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/alexandra-dock-towards-townetsy.jpg?w=1208 1208w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/alexandra-dock-towards-townetsy.jpg?w=105 105w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/alexandra-dock-towards-townetsy.jpg?w=210 210w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/alexandra-dock-towards-townetsy.jpg?w=768 768w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/alexandra-dock-towards-townetsy.jpg?w=717 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px\" /><figcaption>Alexandra Dock towards Town</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" type=\"1\" start=\"5\"><li><strong>what motivates you to paint?&nbsp;</strong></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a compulsion.

We write a lot, and we write in our own unique styles. We break many of the rules of writing that we were taught at school, but we don’t worry about that because it’s our group, it’s our own individual style, and it makes us happy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve been working hard over the months since lockdown ended. So, when we were given the chance to rent a beach hut in Cleethorpes for a day, we quickly became kids again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once we’d unlocked the hut, and once we’d finished with the oohs and ahs over the quaint little sink (I know, we were in a state of great excitement), we put the kettle on. It took ages to boil on the camping stove.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ines did a stress-busting session with us. We stamped our feet, swayed and shouted any negative thoughts out into the Humber. It felt wonderful and we were ready for a cuppa after that!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Full of tea and high spirits, we set off as tourists. First stop: the Cleethorpes Light Railway. You should have seen us waving at everyone we passed. Even dogs got a wave. Pat was humming the theme tune to Ivor the Engine all afternoon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The smell of the steam engine took me back to my childhood in the old steam days.&nbsp;Ryan the engine driver couldn’t help but notice our enthusiasm and he let us each in turn have our photo taken on the foot plate.&nbsp;Kelly did us proud as our official photographer, as you can see from the photos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the way back to the beach hut we ordered breakfast buns and tucked in while we waited for the kettle to boil – again!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The weather was wild, but none of us noticed. In fact, we were pleased it was blowing a gale because we had kites. That’s when we really became children again. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was something I haven’t done since I was nine or ten and on the whole, we did a good job. Even when we couldn’t get them airborne, we had a good laugh. The Olympic gold medal went to Ines, who flew her kite with great expertise.

It makes you jump out of bed in the morning because you feel challenged and hopeful at the same time. It calls to that which is emerging and makes you want to be an active part of change. Rebecca Solnit puts it well: ‘Hope is an axe you break down doors with in an emergency; … hope should shove you out the door, because it will take everything you have to steer the future away from endless war, from the annihilation of the earth’s treasures and the grinding down of the poor and the marginal… To hope is to give yourself to the future, and that commitment to the future makes the present inhabitable’.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In other words, optimism is the force that enables you to create a new reality.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Optimism is not the </strong><strong><em>result</em></strong><strong> of achieving a task we have set for ourselves. That is a celebration. Optimism is the necessary </strong><strong><em>input</em></strong><strong> to meeting a challenge.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Optimism is about having steadfast confidence in our ability to solve big challenges. It is about making the choice to tenaciously work to make the current reality better.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Optimism is about actively proving, through every decision and every action, that we are capable of designing a better future.’</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\" data-attachment-id=\"1537\" data-permalink=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/pooh/\" data-orig-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pooh.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"800,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"pooh\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pooh.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pooh.jpg?w=800\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pooh.jpg?w=800\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1537\" srcset=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pooh.jpg 800w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pooh.jpg?w=150 150w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pooh.jpg?w=300 300w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pooh.jpg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></figure>\n","<p>After a week where we Proud East Marshians showed and felt the real power of our community in solidarity, I wanted to share this passage from the book ‘The Future We Choose’ by Christiana Figueres and Tom Rivett-Carnac about the importance of remaining optimistic and nurturing optimism. “Optimism empowers you; it drives your desire to &hellip; <a href=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/2021/09/30/optimism/\" class=\"more-link\">Continue reading <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Optimism</span> <span class=\"meta-nav\">&rarr;</span></a></p>\n",{"image_generator_settings":"9755","version":2},"post-1534",["9756"],["9757"],["9758"],["9759"],["9760"],["9761"],["9762"],["9763"],["9764"],["9765","9766"],["9767"],["9768"],["9769"],["9770"],["9771","9772"],"https://eastmarshunited.org/?p=1487","The Carer&#8217;s Support Service &#8211; free information, support and advice 7 Days a&nbsp;Week","\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"701\" height=\"994\" data-attachment-id=\"1488\" data-permalink=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/capture/\" data-orig-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/capture.png\" data-orig-size=\"701,994\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"capture\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/capture.png?w=212\" data-large-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/capture.png?w=701\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/capture.png?w=701\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1488\" srcset=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/capture.png 701w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/capture.png?w=106 106w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/capture.png?w=212 212w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 701px) 100vw, 701px\" /><figcaption>The Carer&#8217;s Support Service</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A Carer is someone of any age who provides necessary care to a child, relative, partner or friend in need of help because they have an illness (including mental illness), disability, frailty or substance misuse problem.

Right here, right now. And I guess we each feel collectively helpless in the face of such huge problems. I certainly do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there we were in our Grant Thorold Park. Singing, dancing, talking, laughing, being together genuinely in community, in our East Marsh community along with our friends who came to stand with us. And early reports from our engagement tent suggests that something may have shifted also in the collective East Marshian mindset &#8211; previous events would find people&#8217;s concerns focusing on the negatives, on what is out there now: the consequences of drug use on our streets and in our families, fly tipping, frequent eruptions of anger and violence. These are very real and out there, and we need to acknowledge the impact on our lives. However, feedback on Saturday was almost completely about future plans and what we can do together to really change our park and our streets, to change our East Marsh Village. The day was about standing together connected in love and joy and knowing that this is our strength, this is our foundation, and from here we can remake our East Marsh for our children to grow and flourish.

Those projects do great work and they are important. The problem is that the East Marsh is suffering from the effects of too many problems across all areas of life, and all of the consequences of those problems crossover and have an impact. Housing impacts health which impacts education which impacts work which impacts aspiration. Tackling one of these issues literally means tackling all of them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This leads me to talk about the environment, the physical place where we live.

This is the narrative that we know and it is of course central to the work that is being done. EMU is tackling the mess, the neglect, the attitude and behaviour of slum lords who have allowed the houses to fall into such disrepair, through targeted project work. The East Marsh Construction CIC is tackling work by employing local people to work on improving housing, to undertake repairs and maintenance. This work is happening slowly and it will build.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is however, another side to the East Marsh; a side that is hidden behind the houses, visible to the residents when they open their back doors and look out. It might come as a surprise to see the view from our backyard, but here it is:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"497\" data-attachment-id=\"1381\" data-permalink=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/view/\" data-orig-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/view.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"5664,2752\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;1.7&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;SM-A920F&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1628686661&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;3.93&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;50&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.00056657223796034&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;longitude&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"View\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/view.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/view.jpg?w=1024\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/view.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1381\" srcset=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/view.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/view.jpg?w=2046 2046w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/view.jpg?w=150 150w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/view.jpg?w=300 300w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/view.jpg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"497\" data-attachment-id=\"1380\" data-permalink=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/gordons/\" data-orig-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/gordons.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"5664,2752\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;1.7&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;SM-A920F&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1628686665&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;3.93&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;50&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.00091911764705882&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;longitude&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Gordon&#8217;s\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/gordons.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/gordons.jpg?w=1024\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/gordons.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1380\" srcset=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/gordons.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/gordons.jpg?w=2046 2046w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/gordons.jpg?w=150 150w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/gordons.jpg?w=300 300w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/gordons.jpg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We have grand, old trees, a skyline that is not just brick and concrete. It is green and verdant. There are many varieties of birds &#8211; not just seagulls &#8211; even bats at dusk. It is a pleasure to watch the trees as they traverse the seasons, moving from their skeletal frames in winter to their rich greens in high summer and their warm reds and browns in autumn. It is comforting to listen to the wind blow through leaves on blustery days and to hear the songs of blackbirds, finches, starlings and sparrows.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, let’s imagine that we could take some of what is at the back of our houses and apply it to the front, to the streets. Let’s re-imagine street architecture to involve trees, bushes, planters. And let’s go even further. Let’s reduce traffic, let’s find a 20th century solution for those stinking wheelie bins, let’s have a play area for our kids and benches for us to sit with our neighbours and have a chat and a catch up. In short, let’s build a safer, greener, softer place for us all to live.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How hard can it be? We have a government in power that wants to <em>level up. </em>There is money to do this. Here on the East Marsh we have a vision. We can imagine our community as a village, a place where people can live, work, go to school, get together safely under the shade of trees, on pleasant streets where neighbours sit together watching the kids play over a brew and a biscuit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know this can be done, because it has been done elsewhere. What we need is to imagine it, plan it and do it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is already starting. I am watching with great interest the transformation of the Wellspring Academy on Harold Street. Wooden cladding, flower beds and grassy areas have all appeared this summer. Someone imagined that, planned it and made it happen. The kids returning to school in September will be welcomed into a softer, kinder, nicer place. It will have an impact on how they see the environment and their place in it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>East Marsh United is planning to undertake significant work in Grant Thorold Park and on the streets; we will remake our environment. We have imagined it, we are planning it, we will do it. But… we need help. We need friends, allies and doers to come and join us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, EMU tidied a garden up, cut back waste, sorted it out so the resident could feel supported and less worried about their outdoor space.&nbsp; Over a couple of hours, the crew worked, talked and imagined a better East Marsh. We looked at the trees, smelled the wild jasmine, and unearthed an old rose. We heard the birds &#8211; including our amazing seagulls and we really appreciated the environment. In a small but significant way, we showed what can be done.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s make our village together, let’s remake our environment in the shape we want, and let&#8217;s make it green, healthy and beautiful.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"497\" data-attachment-id=\"1378\" data-permalink=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/crew/\" data-orig-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/crew.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2016,980\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Crew\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/crew.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/crew.jpg?w=1024\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/crew.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1378\" srcset=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/crew.jpg?w=1022 1022w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/crew.jpg?w=150 150w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/crew.jpg?w=300 300w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/crew.jpg?w=768 768w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/crew.jpg 2016w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>The EMU Crew</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n","<p>The idea of doing everything all at once all the time sounds crazy, impossible even but it is the mantra that underpins the work and the ambition of East Marsh United.&nbsp; There are many examples of projects that cover a particular area such as housing, or health or education.

It has talking animals and a giant with green legs along with a kind, brave and clever heroine, Carrie. It also has a serious message and that is about habitat. We know that many habitats are under serious threat and many animal species face vast reduction in numbers or extinction. In the face of this, it can seem impossible for individuals &#8211; let alone children &#8211; to do anything positive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my stories, I try to offer ideas that can help children find small ways to help animals, each other and the environment. In <em>The Magic Garden, </em>Carrie helps protect the habitat of small creatures by not digging up dandelion patches, and her friend Cosmo builds a hedgehog house. These are simple things. On their own, maybe they seem very small.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But imagine if 10,000 gardeners stopped pulling up all the dandelions, or planted lavender and other pollen rich plants instead of short-lived plants that just die off after one summer. Imagine if one thousand gardens had a bug hotel or a hedgehog box or a bee house &#8211; that would make a difference.<strong> We always have to start somewhere.

I have a couple of birdbaths and a bee hotel hidden away in a shady place under some lovely creeping ivy.&nbsp;I’ve shared a couple of photos of my garden, I hope you like them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"869\" data-attachment-id=\"1364\" data-permalink=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/mg-p2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mg-p2.png\" data-orig-size=\"2007,1705\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"mg-p2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mg-p2.png?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mg-p2.png?w=1024\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mg-p2.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1364\" srcset=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mg-p2.png?w=1024 1024w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mg-p2.png?w=150 150w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mg-p2.png?w=300 300w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mg-p2.png?w=768 768w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mg-p2.png 2007w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This Tuesday, not long after the first episode aired, there was a knock at my front door.

In this story, Carrie and Cosmo help the animals that live in Carrie’s garden to find safe homes. We meet Susan the Hedgehog and Barry the Beetle, who need help in overcoming threats to their habitat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You can find Part 1 here: <a href=\"https://www.buzzsprout.com/1764181/8961190\">https://www.buzzsprout.com/1764181/8961190</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The story is part of a package of materials and resources that were created during 2020 as part of a bigger project, funded by Arts Council England and the NEL Music Hub in partnership with Grimsby Jazz Projects. <em>The Magic Garden</em> is available as a storybook, suitable for children aged&nbsp; 4+ and for family reading. There is also a teachers’ resource book available. For more details about the books, please email <a href=\"mailto:msjosiemoon@gmail.com\">msjosiemoon@gmail.com</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The original music for this podcast is by Pat McCarthy and Hetty McCarthy.

You can follow their space adventures in this video series: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkYoq8_CEEA&amp;t=57s\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkYoq8_CEEA&amp;t=57s</a> &#8211; where Matt Gray and Lisa February bring Carrie and Cosmo to life in this fun series.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cosmo and Carrie also set sail in Bonny the Boat to face the terrible peril facing the ocean in the form of Plastic Pete. On their journey they met a wise whale, a clever dolphin and a brave crab; Carlos, the leader of the Crustaceans of Cleethorpes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Let’s Go To Space</em> and <em>Sail Away</em> are also available as storybooks and resource packs.

Rather we sat down together to work out what had brought our neighbourhood to this. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, surprise! We found that poverty played a very important part and that poverty is not a lack of character, it&#8217;s a lack of cash &#8211; but it&#8217;s also about not having access to the benefits of civilisation &#8211; which is why we now have projects in mutual aid, community arts and community education. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a lot of help from friends at the council we have also bought three houses and aim to buy 100 over time so that we can become sustainable over a generation as an ethical community landlord. We also helped get East Marsh Construction under way and they are employing local people doing the refurbishment work that needs doing. We&#8217;re also working with our MP and with Create Streets to really change the architecture of our neighbourhood to make it more people-friendly and to start to green the neglected East Marsh. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If people feel valued, if they have nice homes, nice streets, job opportunities, educational opportunities, health care &#8211; all of the benefits of our civilisation, I would argue they are less likely to be disengaged from society and disrupt the social peace. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a poem by Portia Nelson (below) that sums up what I think we keep doing with our focus on doing the same old things that are clearly not working because we keep on having this discussion and talking about&#8230; doing the same old things! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do you think?

I have reached out a lot throughout the Pandemic with mental health awareness videos and articles. I’ve also been noticed as an ambassador for the local area having spent some time struggling myself throughout my life with mental health and especially in the lockdown.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously I thought about ideas how I could help on how I was feeling and express it in videos and simple messages &#8211; you would be surprised how far they would go and who they would reach. I’ve reached so many celebrities throughout Twitter and they have shared and wrote some lovely positive comments. I just wanted to know if you are feeling down and at times of darkness there is light and by shining a torch through expressing how I was feeling and just a simple message it’s okay not to be okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Others would connect and people would understand that days can be bright but some days can be dark and by doing some videos I have some very positive feedback and messages like how brave I was to open up and Thank you for the videos they have helped me and that made me feel good about myself to as I was struggling at times too but by helping others by doing little bits you find yourself feeling better. I’ve always said if you&#8217;re at that point in your life where you need someone to talk to please talk reach out to friends or a family member &#8211; it’s the start of acknowledging you are struggling but this is not weakness, this is strength. By speaking you will find release and understand that you are not alone and that many others feel the same. By taking time sometimes to have that talk about your day to someone it’s surprising how you can feel afterwards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know myself at times a simple chat can uplift my mood and I’ve just recently mentioned how football can bring people together especially men; a simple conversation about your football team can sometimes unlock a conversation. I find the smallest things we do in life can mean so much and I really appreciate the little messages &#8211; how are you, have a lovely day &#8211; can bring a smile to my face and knowing someone has a thought about you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have met and spoke to some amazing people in my life who have come across some hurdles but take every opportunity to help raise awareness in mental health and these people are warriors who have lived through their experiences. We all share the same interests in helping each other and you would be surprised how much the little things can make the huge difference to someone’s life.  I also met with the Grimsby MP and we spoke about how more in our area needs to be done to continue to raise awareness &#8211; I am all for helping out when I can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know still it’s difficult daily for so many even myself, up and down days, but sometimes all it takes is one person to speak out and you see many more follow and I think that&#8217;s the objective &#8211; to reach out more and more and hopefully it finds the right people because no one should suffer in silence and remember it is okay not to be okay and just because today isn’t great make tomorrow a better day. If you need to talk, talk, reach out, connect. Sometimes a problem shared can help you recognise &#8216;hey I am not the only one experiencing this&#8217; and by knowing you&#8217;re not alone and you can open up as I know for many men it’s hard but finding that strength inside is the start to finding the right help for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take care everyone &#8211; you are not alone. Speak, reach out, don’t suffer in silence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right\">Terry Birkett Grimsby Town mental health ambassador, speaker and advocate&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do check out Terry&#8217;s moving and deeply personal Youtube Channel where he reaches out and connects: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTi_SSchpAMwGn3S_arXnZQ\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTi_SSchpAMwGn3S_arXnZQ </a></p>\n","<p>Hi everyone, my name is Terry Birkett.

On the day, we’ll be chatting about what other things we’d like to change about the park, and find out who’d like to be involved with bringing the project to life.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1121\" data-permalink=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/ezm92wexsaeuft4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ezm92wexsaeuft4.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1536,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"ezm92wexsaeuft4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ezm92wexsaeuft4.jpg?w=225\" data-large-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ezm92wexsaeuft4.jpg?w=768\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ezm92wexsaeuft4.jpg?w=768\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1121\" width=\"301\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ezm92wexsaeuft4.jpg?w=301 301w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ezm92wexsaeuft4.jpg?w=602 602w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ezm92wexsaeuft4.jpg?w=113 113w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ezm92wexsaeuft4.jpg?w=225 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 301px) 100vw, 301px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you can’t make the call, there are other ways to get your voice heard.

We asked friend of EMU and YMCA Humber Chief Executive Debbie Cook to share her thoughts about that thought-provoking heading &#8216;East Marsh Refuge&#8217;. Here is her heartfelt account &#8211; thank you , Debbie 🙂</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was about 8 years old when my parents separated; at the time I was the only child in my (quite large) primary school whose parents were getting a divorce. Hard to believe that now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before my parents separated for good, I recall two or three occasions when me and my mum would walk up through our village, our bags packed in readiness for a stay at my Granny’s house. I’m guessing that that was my mum’s refuge (but I’ve never asked her in detail). At the time, and indeed now when I look back, I saw it as a place where my mum felt loved, supported, safe, and a place which gave her space to figure things out. We all need a place like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At YMCA Humber we provide a home, primarily for young people in supported accommodation. Our buildings are inclusive places, where our residents can actively engage in the caring support provided by our coaches. For many, our accommodation is a refuge, a place where they feel secure, supported, cared for; a place where they will not be ‘judged’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am incredibly proud of the work YMCA Humber does. Our accommodation service has a range of properties; from our newly renovated houses with intensive support bringing those formerly street homeless into a home, our bespoke property with round the clock support for care leavers, our Foyer project supporting young people into education, training and work and our move on properties for those who need less support. The property that YMCA Humber is most known for though is our hostel at Peaks Lane. The support we provide in this building makes me equally as proud as the support we offer across our range of other properties, but our building at Peaks Lane does not inspire; it is dated and tired and not of the quality we want to provide. That is why we are building our state of the art £8.3m facility at Freeman Street, at the heart of the East Marsh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We chose this location on the East Marsh because 80% of our current residents have a connection to the East Marsh Ward. This ward might represent their refuge, a place of comfort and familiarity. We want to help our residents re-connect with their roots, their families and the heart of the town. This building will provide a refuge for our residents in an area of Grimsby where they feel they belong. This new building will be a home for many, but will also shout out ’you can achieve your hopes and dreams from here’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this new building will be a welcoming space to many more people than our residents. With amazing community facilities on the ground floor it will serve as a happy place, a place to think, a place to learn, a place to grow for people across the whole of the East Marsh and beyond.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everybody needs a refuge at some time in their lives; a caring environment, a safe space to think, to try something new without fear of failure or judgement. For me, my refuge is my home (and my mum’s home) but that’s not the case for everyone. Our new building will be a much-needed refuge for many, but it will also be so much more than that.</p>\n","<p>The cover of the latest issue of the Proud East Marshian (get it here: <a href=\"https://www.sunandmoonfestival.org/proudeastmarshian\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.sunandmoonfestival.org/proudeastmarshian</a>) shows the emerging new YMCA building.

We catch-up with Ernie Brown and chat about his journey from hotel chef to head gardener at Your Place, an oasis tucked away on an East Marsh street.</p>\n<h2>East Marsh Windows</h2>\n<p>And some East Marsh families have been working their magic to transform their front room windows with the craft boxes that Josie has been busy putting together and delivering to homes around the area (she had to be surgically removed from Boyes on more than one occasion)! Add East Marsh imagination to the craft boxes and – hey presto – windows are now storyboards that tell the stories of their family lockdown experiences. As you’d expect, there’s humour (look out for the toilet rolls), there’s empathy and there’s positivity: all the traits that sum-up the East Marsh spirit.</p>\n<p>So, the next time you venture out, keep a look-out for these window theatres.

This project could bring the two communities together from the North of England and the South of England with a view of sharing with each other what they are doing within their own communities and to look at ways of how we might work together to bring about real lasting change in our communities.</p>\n<p>If we agree to work together then a small number of East Marsh residents could come to Deptford for say three days (we would provide the funding for this &#8211; similar to us coming here to Grimsby).  To see whats happening there and to meet people fighting for the right to determine the future of their community.</p>\n<p>The next step following this, if we agree, would be for us to think about seeking funding based on our visits to each other’s communities. One way could be to ‘twin’ both communities and over a two or three-year period residents (including young people) from each community would visit each other to talk, listen and to learn from each other’s experiences and create a model which could be used in similar community’s around the UK of how local people can have a real voice and determine the future development of their communities.</p>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n","<p>UPDATE!

Where do we start? At Tortoise, we believe we need to rewrite the rules for politics in a so-called “codified constitution”. But first, how do we get there? We need to remember how it’s supposed to work, work out what problems we’re solving, design new principles for the deal between the people and the people in charge and create fresh ideas for our democracy.

Even though I sat quiet I was taking all info in and had a great time so thankyou.</p>\n<p>Pete: Although their catchment area could not be more different I think they managed to give a very clear and straightforward blueprint for a community share issue.

Its trajectory of decline, the loss of its major industry and the total neglect of central government has been replicated throughout the North. However, this is not a story of despair. Despite the scars inflicted by poor housing, low pay, insecure employment and a general lack of hope, we here at East Marsh United have been working against the odds to find a route out of this crisis, making change happen by our own collective effort and sheer force of will. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">A significant group of projects are flourishing but our construction arm, which should be an absolute breakthrough initiative has hit unforeseen difficulties. Our objectives are straightforward given that the two major issues in the ward are housing and skilled, well paid employment: we are buying houses, refurbishing them and providing secure, quality, affordable homes for East Marshians. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">We have secured over £200,000 from the Community Housing Fund, initially to buy three houses on the East Marsh and refurbish them. We will then become an ethical community landlord and as we roll out to forty houses in our four-year plan, we will begin to transform the area &#8211; one house at a time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Integral to this is the recruitment of young people to train and to ultimately gain employment. We have hired two construction professionals and this week ten young people begin a four month programme to become industry-ready, working in a hands-on practical environment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The next phase is to start a two-year apprenticeship with permanent employment on completion. Given the time, effort and planning required to get this far from a standing start you would assume that this latter phase would be a seamless progression &#8211; especially given the terrible, urgent need and our own determination to make this happen, to make our East Marsh home beautiful. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Nope. Our application to the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB) was rejected on the grounds that our organisation is involved in areas of activity other than construction. This means that we miss out on the Apprenticeship Levy drawdown of funding to support the training. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">We haven’t given up. It’s too important &#8211; these are our lives &#8211; and we have taken advice on a new application, a new potential avenue to follow. It feels like a permanent uphill struggle, but we do not give up. Above all, we will not stand by and witness some really excellent young people be deprived of a career and a future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">So, we need a helping hand. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">We would like to link with construction employers, large and small and, if possible, the Grimsby Federation of Master Builders to enable us to provide a bridge from our initial training to a full apprenticeship with them. So, we need local employers to partner us. We can offer you keen, industry-ready applicants with a proven record of attendance and timekeeping earned by working in the industry. This is a huge advantage to you rather than the hazard of taking someone on after only an initial interview. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">And money &#8211; if anybody would like to make a donation to us to help us over this early startup difficulty, that would be greatly appreciated. We’re not set up yet for website donations so if you email </span><a href=\"mailto:info@eastmarshunited.org\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">info@eastmarshunited.org</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> I’ll give bank details for a bank transfer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The skills shortage, both nationally, and locally, is critical. Together, we can break this impasse and offer young people in Grimsby the range of opportunities many of us enjoyed at their age. We can give something back while at the same time employing good people and begin to lift the area. Most importantly we can recreate that increasingly elusive dream, the expectation of a rewarding, secure and worthwhile life. </span></p>\n","<p>Grimsby’s East Marsh is one of the most deprived wards in Europe.

Full article can be found here (and it is worth reading the whole thing, as there seems to be little to compare in the four places, except perhaps for an underlying sense that there&#8217;s something terribly wrong with what we have and that change must come &#8211; systemic change, not tinkering around the edges any more: h<a href=\"https://members.tortoisemedia.com/2019/11/25/191125-election-tour/content.html\">ttps://members.tortoisemedia.com/2019/11/25/191125-election-tour/content.html </a></p>\n<h2><strong>Grimsby</strong></h2>\n<p><span class=\"tm-dropcap\">G</span>rimsby is often seen as a bellwether of the strength of political anger: will a Labour Leave-voting constituency forgo its traditional party loyalty for the sake of Brexit? It is a question which misreads the complexity and depth of people’s discontent.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, in the corner room of Grimsby Holiday Inn, the word “Brexit” was uttered once, in passing, and never repeated. Many faces of the town were in the room – sixth formers, community organisers, retirees, volunteers, workers – and nearly all felt let down. The economy, the council, government: very little <em>up there</em> worked for them.</p>\n<p>Key points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Decrepit houses.</em> This part of the discussion naturally focused on East Marsh, one of the most deprived areas in the whole of Europe, let alone Grimsby. The lack of leadership in the ward is typified by its housing: old, uncared for, and of poor quality. A local architect was commissioned by the council to write up a plan, praised by others in the room, to refurbish 15 housing blocks in the area. As far as he is aware, the plans still sit, untouched, in a council drawer somewhere.</li>\n<li><em>“Running in treacle.”</em> The Resolution Foundation diagnosed people’s experience of the job market in four words: “Feel poor, work more.” In the room on Tuesday night, a local seafood employee gave his own four words. They amounted to the same: “Like running in treacle.” A young couple who work 78 hours a week and can barely afford to keep a roof over their heads, and certainly not start a family, is a sign of sickness in the economy.</li>\n<li><em>No recovery.</em> The financial crash still weighs heavily on the town. “Things have just gotten worse and worse since the financial crisis,” said one attendee. Many others agreed. Poor job security, wages that can’t keep up with the rising cost of living, bad prospects particularly for working women. It is no wonder that many young people want out. “There’s this idea,” said a sixth-form student, “that if you come back to your hometown you’ve failed.”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But there is hope, as well as a pride and energy in the town. Local initiatives, such as East Marsh United, want government support to flourish but are not waiting on it to make a start. “This is where we live, this is our home,” said the chair of East Marsh United, a community group trying to renovate housing in the area. “Pensioners shouldn’t have to suffer, young people shouldn’t have to suffer, and, when it comes down to it, us humans shouldn’t have to suffer. That’s it. Full stop. No argument.”</p>\n<p><em>Polly Curtis and David Taylor</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Tortoise will be back in Grimsby twice before the election.

The event, which will run from 10 am – 2 pm at Freeman Street Market, will feature tasters from some of the breads from the calendar, alongside stews, cheeses, and other accompaniments.</p>\n<p>Featuring 12 recipes from 12 different countries, the calendar celebrates the diversity in North East Lincolnshire. It will be a fitting follow-up to the ‘A Town Called Home’ exhibition which proved tremendously popular after its launch in February 2019. Hundreds of visitors flocked to the National Fishing Heritage Centre to read the stories of migrants who have made North East Lincolnshire their home.</p>\n<p>Through Bread from Home, some of these stories will come alive in homes across the county, bringing a little bit of international culture in the form of delicious breads. The Equality Practice, Tracy Todd and Jill Wilson, work closely with people from the Hindu, Sikh, Zimbabwe, Greek, Muslim and Eastern European communities.</p>\n<p>Tracy Todd: “As we chatted about the stories we’d gathered, one theme shone through. Many people spoke about their bread from home. It was something people enjoyed and felt it was part of their life. Sharing their memories of their Bread from their Homes made them smile. We hope this ‘Bread from Home’ Calendar and the recipes it shares, along with the stories, help you reminisce, smile and enjoy, during 2020.”</p>\n<p>The calendar has been a true community effort, with local photographers Inga Bertholds Photography, Arleta Sztandera of Light Grey Photography, and Gary Davies Photography donating their time and talents to take fantastic photos. Gary Davies also gave up his time for the design process.</p>\n<p>The steering committee are volunteers who share, with The Equality Practice, their passion for equality and inclusion. Ruchita Green, Shereen Alankar, Agnieszka Singh and Thelma Hairwadzi are local businesswomen and volunteers who were instrumental in bringing the calendar together.</p>\n<p>Jill Wilson: “Of course, the calendar would not have been possible if it wasn’t for all the participant bakers and storytellers. All have donated their time and baking skills to share their bread from home with us. This means together, we can all share our neighbour’s memories and tastes of home with everyone.”</p>\n<p>Supported by the ‘Love Where You Live’ Fund, the event is free and aims to bring communities together and promote neighbourliness. The calendar will be available to buy on the 30th of November at Freeman Street Market, and via the Hidden Heritage Project Facebook page thereafter. All proceeds go towards the next local community project by the Equality Practice.</p>\n<p>For further information please contact Tracy Todd (07523960723) or Jill Wilson (07722117535) or email info@theequalitypractice.co.uk</p>\n","<p>Bread from home – recipes from across the world, A delicious new calendar for 2020!

And from Lee&#8217;s wonderful photos below (we have such talented East Marshians!).</p>\n<p>We all gathered at the Methodist Chapel car park and there was that feeling when you throw a party &#8211; will anybody come? They did, and we were such a happy bunch, fleshed out by our friends at YMCA (thank you!) and NELC (thank you, too!) and some East Marshian kids who had heard about all of this and came along to join in (that&#8217;s their work on the boarded up house in Rutland Street, the lovely cat and dog picture).</p>\n<p>It was a very hot day, so we drank plenty of liquids and treated ourselves with cakes &#8211; and it was Vivienne&#8217;s birthday, so what a memorable way to celebrate a phenomenal human! On top of everything we had our Granarchists leading us all in uplifting songs and a very special appearance by the gifted tenor <a href=\"https://encoremusicians.com/Robin-Datta\">Robin Datta</a>, whose voice echoed and tumbled joyously down the whole of Rutland Street.</p>\n<p>Carolyn, our collector of East Marsh Stories, was out collecting those stories from people who live on the street and our plan to tart up the decrepid boarded up houses was simply astonishing &#8211; all these contributions from the <a href=\"https://www.sunandmoonfestival.org/\">Sun &amp; Moon Festival of Community Arts</a>, what a joy that is turning out to be even in these early days!</p>\n<p>We also had a visit from the Absolutely Clueless <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lucylauraclark\">@LucyLauraClark</a> from Radio Humberside, who have also been supporting us via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ClareCrooks\">@Caeros01</a> and shiny new CEO <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheCarlWheatley\">@TheCarlWheatley</a>.</p>\n<p>It was all such fun, and we&#8217;re very happy about how it went, but we have to put the project aside for a little while as we have made a bid for funding to support a whole year of it (it&#8217;s not cheap to do this stuff!). However, now we&#8217;ve had a tryout, we can improve on the way we do it &#8211; and if you have any ideas for improvement, please contact us or leave a comment below.

We want to make a big splash on each ‘Six Feet’ day.</li>\n<li>On the day, we will have our street cleaning volunteers armed with equipment and ready to help everybody and to clean where people are not able to &#8211; some people won’t be able to come and clean their patch, in which case we just ask that they come out and enjoy the morning with us and have a chat about what they love about our community.</li>\n<li>We will hang out our hanging baskets.</li>\n<li>We will have volunteers also from another East Marsh United project, the Sun &amp; Moon Festival performing and being creative – ‘The Granarchists’, our nascent community choir, our growing arts collectives will be decorating the boarded up windows, and our storytellers and writers will be catching ‘East Marsh Stories’ from locals, as well as stories about their tattoos, which very often have a local flavour.</li>\n<li>We will also be promoting East Marsh United’s projects more broadly as a way of bringing more people in to work with and for our community, as well as identifying one or two ‘community mobilisers’ from each street, people who have some heart and passion which we can foster in order to help them support their street in a continuing basis.</li>\n<li>We will start each campaign event by gathering people together and singing a song: Bring me Sunshine&#8230;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In summary, ‘Six Feet of Your Street’ is a programme of community action whereby the community themselves are taking the action and transforming their neighbourhood.

we East Marshians spent the day communicating with our fellow humans and it felt relaxed and happy and unforced and positive and connected and bursting full with Love and Care and yes it felt JOYOUS!</p>\n<p>We communicated through the power of song, the power of spoken word, the power of historical record (you&#8217;d be surprised how powerful that can be &#8211; our past informs where we are now and where we might want to be&#8230;), the power of art and colour and making and most of all, most of all&#8230; the power of being alongside each other and sharing, sharing food, sharing drink, sharing our stories and above all the power of simply&#8230; Being Together in the World.</p>\n<p>We will be collating our general impressions and our specific ideas (file under &#8216;lots of&#8217;) to help build a 3-year programme of arts and crafts and people power across our East Marsh.</p>\n<p>Thank you to our amazing volunteers, thank you to our artists, thank you to Sean and &#8220;the Mad Harry Atmosphere&#8221; of Freeman Street Market, thanks to SCOPE for lending us a sofa and two armchairs, thank you to the bold and brilliant marvellous marshian who surprised us all by giving us an acapella version of Waterloo, thank you to our superb camerawoman who will be producing a short film of the day for us (can&#8217;t wait!), thank you to the four cafes on the market that provided food for everybody that came and stood with us and thank you to those lovely humans who came and shared beautiful stories and parts of themselves and their experience &#8211;

There are on this project clever, serious, passionate people who hold a compassionate and progressive view of humanity and choose to spend their time fighting to help people. East Marsh United works side by side with and values these lovely people and their amazing work and we will continue to stand with them and work with them. And there are lots of organisations converging on the fabulous Tea in the Park at Grant Thorold today, who similarly care passionately about humanity and work very hard to make people&#8217;s lives better. I have met and worked with many of them over the past year or so, charities, police, council, social enterprises, businesses, and our group and I personally have gained immeasurably by being with them; the people of the East Marsh have gained immeasurably from their work, which is often unsung and below the radar. The gathering in the park today is thanks to the truly lovely people at radio Humberside, who are offering many the chance to talk about their work. This is great and we celebrate each and every one of them (and do listen out to Radio Humberside today to hear live the great things that are going on around the East Marsh, and look out for a repeat of the Real Estates Radio Show from the East Marsh on 22nd February at 7pm).</p>\n<p>But.</p>\n<p>When you walk down Rutland street &#8211; for example &#8211; it is very little changed from the chaotic mess it was a year and a half ago when our group began working to address that very chaos. This tells me that many of these lives, these fellow humans &#8211; us, our people! &#8211; still are chaotic. As far as we know, nobody, not one person, not one group, not one organisation, is currently looking at the entire street scene itself in a total and comprehensive way. What if there were some kind of a plan we could put into action to make our streets safer, to let our kids play out in their neighbourhoods, to solve the flytipping and rubbish problems, to reduce crime, to slow cars down and to make our East Marsh a beautiful, pleasing place to live?</p>\n<p>Well, there is. It&#8217;s called the East Marsh Neighbourhood Renewal Area Action Plan and it is big and bold and beautiful and if it were put into action it would transform the East Marsh for a generation.</p>\n<p>Architect Mark Hodson, of Hodson Architects wrote the plan after being commissioned by NELC in 2010. It includes a menu of projects ranging from the very small to the very large, all of which are still relevant. In fact, very little has changed since the plan was published, apart, perhaps, from the fact that the area has further deteriorated during &#8216;austerity&#8217;. As Mark says, the plan offers &#8220;fundamental insight into the predominant physical and social issues facing the East Marsh&#8221;. Reading the plan in 2019, this is still the case.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what NELC said in the plan nearly a decade ago: &#8220;The regeneration of the East Marsh is a major priority for North East Lincolnshire Council and its partners&#8221;. For whatever reason, it clearly isn&#8217;t a priority now. But, it IS a priority for we East Marshians. I would love to hear from people who live on the East Marsh, people who work on the East Marsh, those friends and partners working on and for the East Marsh at the park today &#8211; read the plan, imagine it a reality, would it help in your work with children and families, would it help with your work in preventing crime, would it help with your work in education, in health..?</p>\n<p>This visionary plan, put into action, would help to make us East Marshians proud of our East Marsh once again.</p>\n<p>So, if it&#8217;s there, why isn&#8217;t it happening?</p>\n<p>First of all, such a plan is not on the agenda of any of the helping agencies, it is not on the agenda of the council. The Freemen are making some amazing change happen at the docks end of the East Marsh, but it&#8217;s not where we are, where we live, and as far as I know, apart from the potential &#8216;knock-ons&#8217; of the changes in the Freeman Street area, there are no actual plans to become involved in our patch &#8211; and why would they, they are not responsible for it&#8230;  (we are!)</p>\n<p>Secondly, there is a localised sense of not being able to do anything about anything &#8211; it all seems such a big mess and, well, who knows how to even start?</p>\n<p>But, here&#8217;s the thing. We can do something because we have on our side the heart and strength and passion of we East Marshians, the determination and power held by people who get organised and stand together in common purpose. So, let&#8217;s take this wonderful plan and make it a reality. Let&#8217;s change our world.</p>\n<p>This mess, this chaos that we see around us here, has been made by us humans. Us humans can also unmake it and remake it, but better. Much better. Beautiful. We East Marshians are responsible for OUR East Marsh. We East Marshians CAN make change happen (East Marsh United have been doing it for a year, alongside all our friends and partners). So, let&#8217;s work to make OUR East Marsh beautiful for the generations of young and growing children and make it a place, a neighborhood, a home where they can say &#8216;I&#8217;m a Proud East Marshian&#8217;.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the plan.Let&#8217;s start by sharing the plan as widely as possible and then let&#8217;s find a way to make it a reality.</p>\n<p>Click on this link to download the plan and read for yourself &#8211; and please do share this post and the plan itself, let&#8217;s get it out there and let&#8217;s transform the East Marsh together:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"https://t.ly/K9Gr\">https://t.ly/K9Gr</a></p>\n","<p>Last night I attended a community event by &#8216;Together for Childhood&#8217; &#8211; a fabulous, truly community-minded project funded by NSPCC designed to try and make a real difference to the lives of kids and families in the town.

This is your chance to have your say in the first event of its kind hereabouts.</p>\n<p>Facilitated by the passionate educationist and all round fabulous human Martin Yarnit, who describes himself as &#8220;A naive democrat, I see TALKSHOP helping to create an active and informed citizenry, and making politics a joyful and creative activity. And it’s cheap.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re not sure whether to come along and miss celebrity insect eaters or whatever, try a little thought experiment called &#8216;cognitive dissonance&#8217; (the mental conflict that occurs when assumptions are contradicted by new information): So &#8211; our country, Great Britain is often said to be the sixth richest country on earth. Well, try standing anywhere here on the East Marsh and then say it out loud. There: cognitive dissonance!</p>\n<p>Some of the things that East Marsh United have been exploring with our partners in the Council and in local and national charitable organisations have been centrally about the distribution of power and resources.  Do we feel we have a share in the national distribution of resources? Should we have? Will Brexit bring greater control, more power to the people? The aim of this event is to see whether we can reach some measure of agreement about how well the country and the economy is run and what can be done to improve matters.</p>\n<p>It takes place from 6-9pm at the Grimsby Neighbourhood Centre, 289a Weelsby St, Grimsby  DN32 7JW. If you would like to attend please just come along &#8211; although it helps us with planning if you register with eventbrite at <a href=\"https://goo.gl/TC4iAu\">https://goo.gl/TC4iAu</a></p>\n<div class=\"tiled-gallery type-rectangular tiled-gallery-unresized\" data-original-width=\"500\" data-carousel-extra='{&quot;blog_id&quot;:133614333,&quot;permalink&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/eastmarshunited.wordpress.com\\/2018\\/11\\/27\\/how-should-britain-be-run-come-along-join-in-have-your-say-this-thursday-6pm-grimsby-neighbourhood-centre\\/&quot;,&quot;likes_blog_id&quot;:133614333}' itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageGallery\" > <div class=\"gallery-row\" style=\"width: 500px;

Text by Tammy&#8230;</p>\n<blockquote><p>After a long hard year of fundraising to rebuild Albion Street Park the team from &#8220;a walk in the park&#8221; are very proud to say we now have a timber trail in the park. The children that use this park often were thrilled when this got put in and it has proved to be very popular with the children who could be seen after school lining up to have a go on the trail. It has took a lot of hard work and a lot of hours to get to this point but to see the big smiles on the children&#8217;s faces made it all worth while. We hope you can continue to support us in this adventure to get more equipment put in the park area. Thank you to everyone who has supported us this far.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"tiled-gallery type-rectangular tiled-gallery-unresized\" data-original-width=\"500\" data-carousel-extra='{&quot;blog_id&quot;:133614333,&quot;permalink&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/eastmarshunited.wordpress.com\\/2018\\/11\\/20\\/guest-post-from-a-walk-in-the-park-there-is-now-a-timber-trail-for-the-kids-in-albion-street-park\\/&quot;,&quot;likes_blog_id&quot;:133614333}' itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageGallery\" > <div class=\"gallery-row\" style=\"width: 500px;

It is true that the experience of toxic stress in families adversely affects the developing brain both in the womb and early childhood. However, the social, environmental and economic context all have an impact on an individual&#8217;s ability to provide a nurturing, secure and healthy start for children. Therefore, it must be our collective responsibility to tackle the issue of ACE’s.</p>\n<p>In Gabor Mate’s talk on toxic stress (see video below) it highlighted to me that unless we think deeply together about how we support communities, we will always be shaking our individual sticks (so to speak) at interventions that at best are not joined up (with limited benefit) and worst make little impact on supporting children to be the very best they can be and increase their chances of developing long term poor health issues. To this end, how do we all come together and think about addressing children’s needs within the broader economic, environmental and social context in which families live?</p>\n<div class=\"embed-youtube\"><iframe title=\"Gabor Mate - Toxic Culture - How Materialistic Society Makes Us (FULL)\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/W_ALpvLadQI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>This post by Lisa Smith.

As Phil says, things have really begun to change in the aftermath of last year&#8217;s horrors on our streets, when action was taken by police and by the community. And as a result of these broadcasts, we&#8217;ve had a deluge of emails, texts and social media exchanges that have been positive, encouraging and proud. Just today, I heard from a landlord from out of town who saw us on the tellie and has himself been encouraged by these changes.

Our bid was entitled &#8216;Finding solutions closest to the challenge&#8217; and the following text is from our bid answering the question &#8216;What would you like to do?&#8217;</p>\n<blockquote><p>Grimsby’s East Marsh is one of the most deprived wards in England with significant poverty indicators and problems of low educational attainment, low employment, high numbers of lone parents, high in-work and pensioner poverty. The summer of 2017 saw the area spiralling out of control: “Rutland Street families &#8216;scared to leave their homes&#8217; because of drug dealing and anti-social behaviour”. “Grimsby man refuses to stop speaking out after his Rutland Street home is attacked by vandals”. Just two of many newspaper headlines from one East Marsh street. Residents felt frightened and helpless &#8211; until we decided to act.</p>\n<p>We adopted the ‘broken window’ theory. Signs of disorder &#8211; broken windows, boarded-up houses, litter and graffiti &#8211; induce more disorder and crime, imply no care for the area and invite chaos, which was what happened. We met to identify how we might mend the ‘broken windows’ and ‘East Marsh United’ (EMU) was born!</p>\n<p>Since September, we have held weekly meetings and since October we have met every Saturday morning to clean one East Marsh Street at a time &#8211; removing greenery from gutters and walls, sweeping, litter-picking, bagging and disposing of ½ tonne of waste each time.</p>\n<p>We’ve made an impact. We are reclaiming ownership of our East Marsh. Recent twitter: “Those closest to the challenge have the greatest insights and the best solutions”; our Chief Inspector’s unprompted response: “Totally agree with this as @EastMarshUnited are proving”.</p>\n<p>And now we need funding. We started in the midst of a desperate situation. We now find ourselves with community spirit and a vision of hope. We want to build on this, bring in more ‘East Marshers’, develop and grow our community to make a substantial and sustainable difference. We need help to move towards our larger ideals, supporting a calendar year of projects:</p>\n<p>1. Develop EMU, directors and community members, by:<br />\na. Training. Bid-writing/funding, IT, basic project management.<br />\nb. Developing a community action plan.<br />\nc. Visits to/from other community groups across the UK<br />\n2. Reach out to ‘East Marshers’ by:<br />\na. Holding a Summer Fun Day and Consultation Event (July/August); residents can tell us about the future East Marsh, enjoy music, activities, food and drink.<br />\nb. Promotional materials &#8211; a regular EMU newsletter showcasing the difference in the community because we’ve listened and will listen; inviting more ‘East Marshers’<br />\n3. Places and Spaces- transforming our streets through:<br />\na. Clearance and Cleaning &#8211; our volunteers will continue cleaning our streets and build on the work carried out. We need PPE, bags, speakers and mp3 player (helps get the children involved!) a jet wash, trolley and secure, weather-proof store.<br />\nb. Introducing plants and trees, developing a soft landscaping plan.</p>\n<p>We’ve included community feedback in the design and development of the activities via a local event in August this year. Through the activities we will recruit new volunteers and carry out a wider consultation. Carrying out this project will help us develop a stronger community, see what does and doesn’t work and evidence our impact and achievements.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Thanks to the Big Lottery Fund and thanks to everybody who helped us put the bid together and who have given us such wonderful support in our early days!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"343\" data-permalink=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/2018/02/16/successful-awards-for-all-bid-for-east-marsh-united/awards-for-all-logo/\" data-orig-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/awards-for-all-logo.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"400,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Awards for All Logo\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/awards-for-all-logo.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/awards-for-all-logo.jpg?w=400\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" class=\" size-medium wp-image-343 aligncenter\" src=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/awards-for-all-logo.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300\" alt=\"Awards for All Logo\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/awards-for-all-logo.jpg?w=300 300w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/awards-for-all-logo.jpg?w=150 150w, https://eastmarshunited.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/awards-for-all-logo.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n","<p>We are VERY pleased to announce that we have been awarded a grant of £10,000 for our work on the East Marsh.

Thanks also to the lovely lass from Hildyard Street who made us all tea and coffee 🙂</p>\n<p>Two more street cleans and we&#8217;ve covered the whole of the POWW. POWW is (our name for) the square block of houses contained by <strong>P</strong>ark Street, <strong>O</strong>xford Street, <strong>W</strong>eelsby Street and <strong>W</strong>ellington Street &#8211; we&#8217;re focusing on this section of the East Marsh  because it&#8217;s where most of us at this point in EMU&#8217;s development live and because it&#8217;s manageable as a starting point, a kind of pilot for our ideas for claiming ownership once more of the streets and homes of our historic East Marsh.</p>\n<p>The hardest job so far has been the greenery growing from the sides of houses, walls, paths and gutters. Once that has been cleared in the whole area, it should be relatively straightforward to simply pick up the litter on the streets, no need of the hoes and spades, so we&#8217;ll be getting through perhaps two or three streets in one shift &#8211; who knows perhaps more, perhaps all six&#8230;</p>\n<p>And we can then perhaps begin to look outward from the POWW and see if other groups of residents might want to come together and foster change in their little bit of the East Marsh. We&#8217;re also exploring solutions for those bigger fly-tipped items, wheelie bins and boarded up houses &#8211; these will take a little more time to set up, but&#8230; we are DETERMINED!</p>\n<p>To see the photos from Hildyard Street on Saturday &#8211; if you’re on the web, they’re to the right of this post, and our social media links with the photos are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/eastmarshunited/?hl=en\">https://www.instagram.com/eastmarshunited</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EastMarshUnited\">https://twitter.com/EastMarshUnited</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please do have a look, share, follow and/or come and join us cleaning Harold Street this Saturday 9.45am.

We are just people who live here and by doing this we are standing together and showing that we CARE. And it was great that people passing by stopped to say hello and residents came out of their houses to cheer us on. We also value the support we have from Paul (another East Marsher!) and the guys at the council. And we value the support we get from people who don&#8217;t want publicity for their generosity &#8211; business owners, retailers, council employees, labour party: you know who you are, so thanks!</p>\n<p>We took two minutes out yesterday to be silent and remember those killed in murderous wars. We all had our own private thoughts during this brief time of reflection and I found it extremely moving to stand with my fellow East Marshers. I thought about the Grimsby Chums and about those from Grimsby caught up in the mayhem out at sea, how the lives of people just like us were taken or damaged and it makes my resolve stronger than ever.
